    "text": "Crafting System Instructions for LearnLM\nThe system instruction is the primary way you tell LearnLM what kind of tutor to be and how to behave. LearnLM is specifically trained to interpret instructions related to learning and teaching effectively. Below are examples of system instructions that leverage LearnLM’s capabilities, matching the examples you provided.\n\nTest Prep\nThis system instruction is for an AI tutor to help students prepare for a test. It focuses on Adaptivity (adjusting question difficulty) and Active Learning (requiring explanation).\n\nconst TEST_PREP_INSTRUCTION = `\n    You are a tutor helping a student prepare for a test. If not provided by\n    the student, ask them what subject and at what level they want to be tested\n    on. Then,\n\n    *   Generate practice questions. Start simple, then make questions more\n        difficult if the student answers correctly.\n    *   Prompt the student to explain the reason for their answer choice.\n        Do not debate the student.\n    *   **After the student explains their choice**, affirm their correct\n        answer or guide the student to correct their mistake.\n    *   If a student requests to move on to another question, give the correct\n        answer and move on.\n    *   If the student requests to explore a concept more deeply, chat\n        with them to help them construct an understanding.\n    *   After 5 questions ask the student if they would like to continue with\n        more questions or if they would like a summary of their session.\n        If they ask for a summary, provide an assessment of how they have\n        done and where they should focus studying.\n`;\n\nNow, let’s start a chat session with LearnLM using this system instruction and see how it initiates the test preparation\n\nconst chat = ai.chats.create({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  config: {\n    systemInstruction: TEST_PREP_INSTRUCTION,\n  },\n});\n\n\nconst test_prep_response_1 = await chat.sendMessage({\n  message: \"Help me study for a undergrad cognition test on theories of emotion generation.\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(test_prep_response_1.text ?? \"\");\n\nOkay! I can help you with that. We’ll focus on theories of emotion generation for your undergrad cognition test.\nLet’s start with a foundational question. This one is relatively straightforward:\nWhich of the following theories proposes that emotions arise from our interpretation of physiological responses?\n\nJames-Lange Theory\nCannon-Bard Theory\nSchachter-Singer Theory\nAppraisal Theory\n\nPlease choose your answer and, most importantly, explain your reasoning for selecting that answer. This will help us understand your current grasp of the material.\n\n\nNow, let’s simulate the student answering that question and explaining their reasoning.\n\nconst test_prep_response_2 = await chat.sendMessage({\n  message:\n    \"It is James-Lange Theory, as that theory suggests that one feels a certain emotion because their body is reacting in that specific way.\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(test_prep_response_2.text ?? \"\");\n\nThat’s correct! The James-Lange Theory indeed posits that our experience of emotion is a consequence of our physiological responses to external stimuli. You’ve articulated the core concept of the theory well.\nLet’s move on to a slightly more challenging question. This one requires you to compare and contrast different theories:\nImagine you are walking in the woods and encounter a bear. According to the Cannon-Bard Theory, what would happen?\n\nYou would first feel fear, which would then trigger physiological responses like increased heart rate.\nThe sight of the bear would simultaneously trigger the feeling of fear and physiological responses.\nYou would first experience physiological responses, which would then be interpreted as fear.\nYou would assess the situation and then experience fear and physiological responses.\n\nChoose your answer and explain your reasoning.\n\n\nAs you can see, by using the chat.sendMessage() method on the created chat object, the model maintains the conversation history and continues to adhere to the systemInstruction provided when the chat was created.\nSimilarly, you can continue going back and forth while preparing for your test. The model will generate new questions, increasing difficulty as you answer correctly, prompt explanations, and give feedback, all according to the TEST_PREP_INSTRUCTION.",

Guide the student to meet their goals,\n    gently nudging them on task if they stray. Ask guiding questions to help\n    your students take incremental steps toward understanding big concepts,\n    and ask probing questions to help them dig deep into those ideas. Pose\n    just one question per conversation turn so you don't overwhelm the student.\n    Wrap up this conversation once the student has shown evidence of\n    understanding.\n`;\n\nLet’s start a new chat session with LearnLM using this instruction to explore a concept like the “Significance of Interconnectedness of Emotion and Cognition.”\n\nconst concept_exploration_chat = ai.chats.create({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  config: {\n    systemInstruction: CONCEPT_EXPLORATION_INSTRUCTION,\n  },\n});\n\n\nconst concept_exploration_response_1 = await concept_exploration_chat.sendMessage({\n  message: \"Explain the significance of Interconnectedness of Emotion & Cognition\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(concept_exploration_response_1.text ?? \"\");\n\nOkay, let’s dive into the significance of the interconnectedness of emotion and cognition. It’s a big concept, but we can break it down.\nFirst, in your own words, what do you think “cognition” refers to? What kinds of mental processes are we talking about when we talk about cognition?\n\n\nLet’s simulate the student responding to that initial guiding question.\n\nconst concept_exploration_response_2 = await concept_exploration_chat.sendMessage({\n  message:\n    \"Cognition plays a crucial role in shaping and regulating emotions. Our interpretation of a situation determines the emotion and its intensity.\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(concept_exploration_response_2.text ?? \"\");\n\nThat’s a fantastic start! You’ve hit on a key point – the way we interpret a situation definitely influences our emotions.\nCan you give me an example of a time when your interpretation of an event influenced your emotional response? This might help us see how cognition shapes emotion in real-life situations.\n\n\nThis interaction pattern demonstrates how LearnLM, guided by the instruction, facilitates understanding through a series of targeted questions rather than simply providing information directly.",

Why?\n    *   What is one part of the text that you want to **argue** against? Why?\n    *   What is one part of the text that reveals the author's **assumptions**?\n        Why?\n    *   What is one part of the text that you **aspire** to?

As a reminder, the 4 A’s are:\n\nAgree: What is one part of the text that you agree with? Why?\nArgue: What is one part of the text that you want to argue against? Why?\nAssumptions: What is one part of the text that reveals the author’s assumptions? Why?\nAspire: What is one part of the text that you aspire to? Why?\n\nTo start, which of the 4 A’s – Agree, Argue, Assumptions, or Aspire – seems most interesting to you right now? There’s no right or wrong answer, just go with what you feel drawn to!",

Let’s break this problem down.\nThe problem tells us that 20% of the pears in the box are rotten. What does “20%” mean we need to do mathematically? How can we express a percentage as a fraction or a decimal?\n\n\nLearnLM acknowledges the choice and provides a guiding question to help the student start solving the problem.\nNow, simulate the student figuring it out and giving the final answer.\n\nconst homework_response_3 = await homework_chat.sendMessage({\n  message: `\n      Okay, I think I figured it out. 20% of 10 would be one-fifth of 10, that\n      is 2.

Before my term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no means certain. The answers are by no means clear. All of us together, this administration, this Congress, this nation, must forge those answers. But today, were I to offer after little more than a week in office, detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty of responsibility. My remarks, therefore, will be limited, but they will also be candid. To state the facts frankly is not to despair the future, nor to indict the past. The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies and gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust. And while the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings and assets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free and determined people, through its elected officials, to face all problems frankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear. The present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the wake of seven months of recession, three and one half years of slack, seven years of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling farm income. Business bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great Depression. Since 1951, farm income has been squeezed down by 25%. Save for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highest peak in our history. Of some five and one half million Americans who are without jobs, more than 1 million have been searching for work for more than four months. And during each month, some 150,000 workers are exhausting their already meager jobless benefit rights. Nearly 1/8 of those who are without jobs live almost without hope in nearly 100 specially distressed and troubled areas. The rest include new school graduates, unable to use their talents. Farmers forced to give up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family budgets. Skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries as metals, machinery, automobiles, and apparel. Our recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and incomplete. Our gross national product never regained its full potential. Unemployment never returned to normal levels. Maximum use of our national industrial capacity was never fully restored. In short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourceful industrialized country on Earth ranks among the last in the rate of economic growth. Since last spring, our economic growth rate has actually declined. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen below predicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are in inventory. Fewer people are working, and the average work week has shrunk well below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise, so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy. Economic prophecy is at best an uncertain art. As demonstrated by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and I quote, “the most prosperous year in our history.” Unquote. Nevertheless, forecast of continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and 1962 have been made with alarming unanimity. And this administration does not intend to stand helplessly by. We cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plant while awaiting the re-end of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can do to reduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur new productivity, and to foster high economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policies and relative price stability. I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a self-supporting basis, to provide more food for the families of the unemployed and to aid their needy children, to redevelop our areas of chronic labor surplus, to expand the services of the U.S. Employment Office, to stimulate housing and construction, to secure more purchasing power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum wage, to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment, to increase the development of our natural resources, to encourage price stability, and to take other steps aimed at ensuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for increased long-range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating on our weaknesses. It is, I hope, a national program to realize our national strength. Efficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology that can make our goods more competitive is also the key to the international balance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist talk and panicky solutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective. It is true that since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend or invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened. This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11 billion in the last three years, and holders of dollars abroad converted them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5 billion of gold from our reserves. The 1959 deficit was caused in large part by our failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets, the result both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive prices. The 1960 deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of an increase in private capital outflow, seeking new opportunity, higher return, or speculative advantage abroad. Meanwhile, this country has continued to bear more than its share of the West’s military and foreign aid obligations. Under existing policies, another deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961, and individuals in those countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain sufficient to meet our own obligations. All this is cause for concern, but it is not cause for panic, for our monetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve held as backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits, we have some $22 billion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reserves, and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind the value of the dollar for use if needed. Moreover, we hold large assets abroad. The total owed this nation far exceeds the claim upon our reserves, and our exports once again substantially exceed our imports. In short, we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce, to impose exchange controls, to reduce our anti-recession efforts, to fall back on restrictive trade policies or to weaken our commitments around the world. This administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion, and this is a commitment. Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to ease the payment deficits and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies, and cooperative efforts with our allies will get underway immediately. Aimed at attracting foreign investment and travel to this country, promoting American exports at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and financing, curbing tax and custom loopholes that encourage undue spending of private dollars abroad, and through OECD, NATO, and otherwise, sharing with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the current deficit last, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad without placing the full burden on the families of men who have asked to serve our flag overseas. In short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts abroad and to make certain that in the future as in the past, the dollar is as sound as a dollar. But more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance. The current federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a net deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in balance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested, and only if an earlier and sharper upturn in the economy than my economic advisors now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated. Nevertheless, a new administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimates already submitted. Within that framework, barring the development of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy, it is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which, including revenue from a stimulation of the economy, will not of and by themselves unbalance the earlier budget. However, we will do what must be done. For our national household is clutted with unfinished and neglected tasks. Our cities are being engulfed in squalor. 12 long years after Congress declared our goal to be a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family, we still have 25 million Americans living in sub-standard homes. A new housing program, under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be needed this year. Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to continue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940s who overcrowded our schools in the 1950s are now descending in 1960 upon our colleges, with two college students for every one, 10 years from now. And our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the engineers, and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected oceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at the root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school education can no longer be delayed. Medical research has achieved new wonders, but these wonders are too often beyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income, particularly among the aged, a lack of hospital beds, a lack of nursing homes, and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide health care for the aged under Social Security and to increase the supply of both facilities and personnel must be undertaken this year. Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crime cost the taxpayers millions of dollars every year, making it essential that we have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host of problems and projects in all 50 states, though not possible to include in this message, deserves and will receive the attention of both the Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, messages will be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks. But all these problems pale when placed besides those which confront us around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be staggered upon learning even in this brief 10-day period, the harsh enormities of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years. Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult. Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger as weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our analysis over the last 10 days make it clear that in each of the principal areas of crisis, the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend. In Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the security of the entire area from the borders of India and South Vietnam to the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly won independence. We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and indeed in all of the world, freedom for the people and independence for the government, and this nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives. In Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, political unrest, and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroic efforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order, efforts which are now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and decreasing support from many member states. In Latin America, communist agents seeking to exploit that region’s peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles from our shore. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people’s drive for a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic tyranny. Cuban social and economic reforms should be encouraged. Questions of economics and trade policy can always be negotiated, but communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiated. We are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working towards the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle. In Europe, our alliances are unfiled and in some disarray. The unity of NATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by national interest. It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved a common outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary reserves, and a host of other areas, and our close ties with those whose hopes and interests we share are among this nation’s most powerful assets. Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold War. But the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet Union and communist China. We must never be loud into believing that either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination, ambitions which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be profitable roots to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition for prestige, for market, for scientific achievement, even for men’s minds is something else again. For if freedom and communism would compete for man’s allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever increasing confidence. To meet this array of challenges, to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on the world scene, we must re-examine and revise our whole arsenal of tools. One must not overshadow the other. On the presidential coat of arms, the American Eagle holds in his right talent the olive branch, while in his left he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both. First, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibilities require a free world force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a consistent, coherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions about our national requirements, and the faulty estimate and duplication arising from inner service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately how adequate or inadequate our defenses really are. I have therefore instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy. Our ability to fulfill our commitments, the effectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic basis, forces, and warning systems. The efficiency and economy of our operation and organization, the elimination of obsolete basis and installations, and the adequacy, modernization, and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear forces and weapon systems in the light of present and future dangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end of February, and I then shall recommend whatever legislative, budgetary, or executive action is needed in the light of these conclusions. In the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediately three steps most clearly needed now. First, I have directed prompt attention to increase our airlift capacity. Obtaining additional air transport mobility and obtaining it now will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond without discrimination and speed, with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment’s notice. In particular, it will enable us to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widely scattered parts of the globe. B, I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program. Using using unobligated shipbuilding funds now to let contracts originally scheduled for the next fiscal year, will build and place on station at least nine months earlier than planned substantially more units of a crucial deterrent. A fleet that will never attack first, but possess sufficient powers of retaliation concealed beneath the sea to discourage any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security. C, I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program. Until the Secretary of Defense’s reappraisal is completed, the emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and decision making, on cutting down the wasteful duplications and the time lag that have handicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are to keep the peace, we need an invulnerable missile force, powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enough of our own forces to prevent his own destruction. For as I said upon taking the oath of office, only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt, can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. Secondly, we must improve our economic tools. Our role is essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the entire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength to meet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations, to surmount their own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering and unprecedented. The response must be towering and unprecedented as well. Much as Lend Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, which brought such fruitful results. I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and more effective program for assisting the economic, educational, and social development of other countries and continents. That program must stimulate and take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies and provide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so often overlap, conflict, or diffuse our energies and resources. Such a program compared to past programs will require more flexibility for short run emergencies, more commitment to long-term development, new attention to education at all levels, greater emphasis on the recipient nation’s role, their effort, their purpose, with greater social justice for their people, a broader distribution and participation by their people, and more efficient public administration and more efficient tax systems of their own. And orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach. I hope the Senate will take early action approving the convention establishing the organization for economic cooperation and development. This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this development effort, working towards the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For while we are prepared to assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and must not be expected to bear them alone. To our sister Republics of the South, we have pledged a new alliance for progress, Alianza para Progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of culture, intellect, and liberty. To start this nation’s role at this time in that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following. That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged by the Act of Bogota to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but as a first step in the sound development of the Americas. That a new interdepartmental task force be established under the leadership of the Department of State to coordinate at the highest level all policies and programs of concern to the Americas. That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members, strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the hemisphere. That in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities at all levels. And finally, that a food for peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to explore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help hunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own hemisphere. This administration is expanding its Food for Peace program in every possible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe. And I have asked the director of this program to recommend additional ways in which these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace, including the establishment of world food reserves. An even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men and women, not only at our college campuses, but in every age group, who have indicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts, and a part of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize this talent through the formation of a national Peace Corps, enlisting the services of all those with desire and capacity to help foreign lands meet their urgent needs for trained personnel. Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non-communist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the Eastern European people. In order to be prepared to help reestablish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area, whenever this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act, along the lines I proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that will demonstrate our abiding friendship and interest in the people of Poland. Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools. The means of cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must ultimately rest. I have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort, to increase our programs of research and study, and to make arms control a central goal of our national policy under my direction. The deadly arms race and the huge resources it absorbs have too long overshadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms racing from spreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers, powers and to the outer reaches of space. We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed and better prepared to formulate workable proposals of our own and to make sound judgment about the proposals of others. I have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delay in the talks on a nuclear test ban, and it is our intention to resume negotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that is equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty. We must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership, we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the UN. We shall help ensure that it is properly financed. We shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the Secretary General is maintained. And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the world to join with us in strengthening this organization which is far more essential to their security than it is to ours. The only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to the strength of its armies, but according to the strength of its ideas. It deserves the support of all. Finally, this administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Specifically, I now invite all nations, including the Soviet Union, to join with us in developing a weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program, and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe. Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into orbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by removing these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits of this new knowledge available to all. And beyond that, in an effort to extend farm technology to hungry nations, to wipe out disease, to increase the exchanges of scientists and knowledge, and to make our own laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the facilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of us all. We can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even with those with whom we most deeply disagree. And this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law. I have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance of payments, our federal and social budget, and the state of the world. I would like to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executive Branch. We have found it full of honest and useful public servants. But their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has too often been muffled in the morass of committees, timidities, and fictitious theories, which have created a growing gap between decision and execution, between planning and reality. In a time of rapidly deteriorating situations at home and abroad, this is bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country. And we mean to make a change. I have pledged myself and my colleagues in the Cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative, responsibility, and energy in serving the public interest. Let every public servant know whether his post is high or low, that a man’s rank and reputation in this administration will be determined by the size of the job he does and not by the size of his staff, his office, or his budget. Let it be clear that this administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring, that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years, I served the United States Government in that hour of our nation’s need. For only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest, can we bring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our problems are critical, the tide is unfavorable, the news will be worse before it is better. And while hoping and working for the best, we should prepare ourselves now for the worst. We cannot escape our dangers. Neither must we let them drive us into panic or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world, where the balance of power already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and order in its servants, while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for privilege, materialism, and a life of ease. But I have a different view of liberty. Life in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking for it will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the tide is turned, but turn it we must. The hopes of all mankind rest upon us. Not simply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in Laos, the fisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that moves every man and nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future. And in the final analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizens of the Great Republic. In the words of a great president whose birthday we honor today, closing his final State of the Union message, 16 years ago, we pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us.",

While it excels at functional code, it still faces challenges in accurately translating complex visual mockups into fully functional and aesthetically precise UIs.\nKey Topics:\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro Capabilities: Highlighted for its large 1M token context window and overall performance as a coding AI.\nCode Generation:\n\nSuccessfully generated an “Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe” game in Java (Swing) in a single attempt (“one-shot”).\nCreated a “Kitten Cannon” style game using P5.js, requiring minor error corrections (fixed with two additional prompts, making it a “three-shot” overall).\nRecreated a static HTML/CSS layout of the X (Twitter) website, demonstrating visual accuracy but no dynamic functionality.\n\nCode Refactoring: Showcased a significant improvement in refactoring complex Rust code, converting traditional loops to more idiomatic iterators and generally cleaning up the codebase, surpassing other models in this task.\nUI Generation Limitations: Demonstrated struggles with building a precise landing page using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS from a visual mockup, indicating difficulties with complex visual translation and asset integration.\nBenchmarking and Performance: Compared Gemini 2.5 Pro’s performance against other prominent AI models (OpenAI’s GPT-4/o3-mini, Claude 3, DeepSeek, Grok) across reasoning, science, mathematics, code generation, and long context. Gemini showed strong leads in reasoning, science, and mathematics, and competitive performance in code generation and editing.\nInformation Currentness (Grounding): Noted Gemini’s training data extends to March 2025 and its ability to “ground” responses with Google Search for real-time information (e.g., current React.js version).\n\nCall to Action:\n\nEncourages viewers to share their experiences with Gemini 2.5 Pro in the comments.\nAsks Rust developers for their opinion on the refactored Rust code.\nRequests viewers to subscribe, like the video, and enable notifications.\n\nSummary: The video showcases the impressive coding prowess of Google’s new Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model, emphasizing its large context window and strong capabilities in generating and refactoring code. The creator successfully uses Gemini to build a Java Tic-Tac-Toe game in one attempt, a P5.js game with minor fixes, and a static Twitter UI. A key highlight is Gemini’s superior ability to refactor complex Rust code into cleaner, more idiomatic forms. While the model excels in functional coding, it encounters limitations when tasked with generating complex, pixel-perfect user interfaces directly from visual mockups. The creator also presents benchmark comparisons, demonstrating Gemini’s competitive edge over other leading AI models in various domains, including its up-to-date knowledge base. The video concludes by recommending Gemini 2.5 Pro as a powerful and potentially cost-effective tool for developers.",

In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?\n\n\nCMP: Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.\n\n\nCC: Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.\n\n\nCMP: Yes. We think it’s within normal tolerances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.\n\n\nCC: Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.\n\n\nCMP: Okay. We’re pressing on with the procedure.\n\n\nCC: And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we’d like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it’s conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.\n\n\nCMP: Okay. Good idea. That’s being done.\n\n\nCC: Houston. Roger. Out.\n\nThe humor comes from the casual, almost apologetic tone of the controller (“Good idea. That’s being done.”) in response to a seemingly trivial request to cycle some switches, creating a lighthearted contrast to the highly technical nature of the conversation. The astronauts’ matter-of-fact response further enhances this effect.\n\n\nYou can inspect token usage through usageMetadata.

We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We’re breathing again. Thanks a lot.” This expresses the immense relief and joy at Mission Control.\nEvents in the Lunar Module: The transcript then details actions taken by the astronauts inside the Lunar Module, including:\n\nArmstrong and Aldrin confirming the MASTER ARM was ON.\nAldrin noting a “very smooth touchdown.”\nAldrin reporting the venting of oxidizer.\nConfirmation from Houston that Eagle was to STAY for T1 (the first planned post-landing activity).\nFurther actions taken to secure the Lunar Module after landing.\n\nCommunications with Columbia: Michael Collins in the Command Module Columbia is heard confirming that he heard the landing. There’s a brief exchange with Houston and Collins about Columbia’s status.\n\nIn short, the immediate aftermath of the landing announcement focuses on confirmation of the successful landing, actions to secure the Lunar Module, and initial communications with the Command Module and Mission Control, highlighting the relief and the transition to the next phase of the mission.\n\n\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(chat_response_2.usageMetadata, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"promptTokenCount\": 323439,\n  \"candidatesTokenCount\": 287,\n  \"totalTokenCount\": 323726,\n  \"cachedContentTokenCount\": 323384,\n  \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 323439\n    }\n  ],\n  \"cacheTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 323384\n    }\n  ],\n  \"candidatesTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 287\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\ntslab.display.markdown(`\n  As you can see in the \\`usageMetadata\\`, the token usage is split between:\n\n  *  ${chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.cachedContentTokenCount} tokens for the cache,\n  *  ${chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.promptTokenCount} tokens for the input (including the cache, so ${(chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.promptTokenCount ?? 0) - (chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.cachedContentTokenCount ?? 0)} for the actual prompt),\n  *  ${chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.candidatesTokenCount} tokens for the output,\n  *  ${chat_response_2.usageMetadata?.totalTokenCount} tokens in total.\n`);\n\nAs you can see in the usageMetadata, the token usage is split between:\n\n323384 tokens for the cache,\n323439 tokens for the input (including the cache, so 55 for the actual prompt),\n287 tokens for the output,\n323726 tokens in total.\n\n\n\nSince the cached tokens are cheaper than the normal ones, it means this prompt was much cheaper that if you had not used caching.

Long words may be broken up into several tokens. The set of all tokens used by the model is called the vocabulary, and the process of breaking down text into tokens is called tokenization.\nFor Gemini models, a token is equivalent to about 4 characters. 100 tokens are about 60-80 English words.\nWhen billing is enabled, the price of a paid request is controlled by the number of input and output tokens, so knowing how to count your tokens is important.",

    "text": "Tokens in the Gemini API\n\nContext windows\nThe models available through the Gemini API have context windows that are measured in tokens. These define how much input you can provide, and how much output the model can generate, and combined are referred to as the “context window”. This information is available directly through the API and in the models documentation.\nIn this example you can see the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 model has an 1M tokens context window. If you need more, Pro models have an even bigger 2M tokens context window.\n\nconst tslab = require(\"tslab\") as typeof import(\"tslab\");\n\nconst model_info_2_5_flash_preview_05_20 = await ai.models.get({\n  model: \"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\",\n});\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(model_info_2_5_flash_preview_05_20, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\",\n  \"displayName\": \"Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20\",\n  \"description\": \"Preview release (April 17th, 2025) of Gemini 2.5 Flash\",\n  \"version\": \"2.5-preview-05-20\",\n  \"tunedModelInfo\": {},\n  \"inputTokenLimit\": 1048576,\n  \"outputTokenLimit\": 65536,\n  \"supportedActions\": [\n    \"generateContent\",\n    \"countTokens\",\n    \"createCachedContent\",\n    \"batchGenerateContent\"\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nCounting tokens\nThe API provides an endpoint for counting the number of tokens in a request: client.models.countTokens. You pass the same arguments as you would to client.models.generateContent and the service will return the number of tokens in that request.\n\n\nChoose a model\nNow select the model you want to use in this guide, either by selecting one in the list or writing it down. Keep in mind that some models, like the 2.5 ones are thinking models and thus take slightly more time to respond (cf. thinking notebook for more details and in particular learn how to switch the thiking off).\nThe tokenization should be more or less the same for each of the Gemini models, but you can still switch between the different ones to double-check.\nFor more information about all Gemini models, check the documentation for extended information on each of them.\n\nconst MODEL_ID = \"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\";\n\n\n\nText tokens\n\nconst text_response = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: \"What's the highest mountain in Africa?\",\n});\nconsole.log(`Prompt Tokens: ${text_response.totalTokens}`);\n\nPrompt Tokens: 10\n\n\nWhen you call client.models.generateContent (or chat.sendMessage) the response object has a usageMetadata attribute containing both the input and output token counts (promptTokenCount and candidatesTokenCount):\n\nconst text_response_2 = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(text_response_2.text ?? \"\");\n\nYes, that’s a classic and very well-known pangram!\nIt’s famous because it contains every letter of the English alphabet, which makes it useful for testing typewriters, keyboards, and font displays.\n\n\n\nconsole.log(`Prompt Tokens: ${text_response_2.usageMetadata?.promptTokenCount}`);\nconsole.log(`Output Tokens: ${text_response_2.usageMetadata?.candidatesTokenCount}`);\nconsole.log(`Total Tokens: ${text_response_2.usageMetadata?.totalTokenCount}`);\n\nPrompt Tokens: 11\nOutput Tokens: 47\nTotal Tokens: 881\n\n\n\n\nMulti-modal tokens\nAll input to the API is tokenized, including images or other non-text modalities.\nImages are considered to be a fixed size, so they consume a fixed number of tokens, regardless of their display or file size.\nVideo and audio files are converted to tokens at a fixed per second rate.\nThe current rates and token sizes can be found on the documentation.\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\") as typeof import(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\") as typeof import(\"path\");\n\nconst IMG_URL = \"https://goo.gle/instrument-img\";\n\nconst downloadFile = async (url: string, filePath: string) =&gt; {\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`Failed to download file: ${response.statusText}`);\n  }\n  const buffer = await response.blob();\n  const bufferData = Buffer.from(await buffer.arrayBuffer());\n  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, bufferData);\n};\n\nconst filePath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"organ.jpg\");\nawait downloadFile(IMG_URL, filePath);\n\n\ntslab.display.jpeg(fs.readFileSync(filePath));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInline content\nMedia objects can be sent to the API inline with the request:\n\nconst inline_response = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [google.createPartFromBase64(fs.readFileSync(filePath).toString(\"base64\"), \"image/jpeg\")],\n});\nconsole.log(`Image Tokens: ${inline_response.totalTokens}`);\n\nImage Tokens: 259\n\n\nYou can try with different images and should always get the same number of tokens, that is independent of their display or file size. Note that an extra token seems to be added, representing the empty prompt.\n\n\nFiles API\nThe model sees identical tokens if you upload parts of the prompt through the files API instead:\n\nconst file_upload_response = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: filePath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"organ.jpg\",\n    mimeType: \"image/jpeg\",\n  },\n});\nconst file_response = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [google.createPartFromUri(file_upload_response.uri ?? \"\", file_upload_response.mimeType ?? \"\")],\n});\nconsole.log(`File Tokens: ${file_response.totalTokens}`);\n\nFile Tokens: 259\n\n\nAudio and video are each converted to tokens at a fixed rate of tokens per minute.\n\nconst AUDIO_URL =\n  \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/State_of_the_Union_Address_30_January_1961.mp3\";\nconst audioPath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"audio.mp3\");\n\nawait downloadFile(AUDIO_URL, audioPath);\n\n\nimport { ffprobe, FfprobeData } from \"fluent-ffmpeg\";\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any\nffprobe(audioPath, (err: any, metadata: FfprobeData) =&gt; {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(\"Error getting audio metadata:\", err);\n    return;\n  }\n  const { duration } = metadata.format;\n  console.log(`Audio Duration: ${duration} seconds`);\n});\n\nAudio Duration: 2610.128938 seconds\n\n\nAs you can see, this audio file is 2610s long.\n\nconst audio_file_response = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: audioPath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"audio.mp3\",\n    mimeType: \"audio/mpeg\",\n  },\n});\n\nconst audio_response = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [google.createPartFromUri(audio_file_response.uri ?? \"\", audio_file_response.mimeType ?? \"\")],\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Audio Tokens: ${audio_response.totalTokens}`);\nconsole.log(`Tokens per second: ${audio_response.totalTokens / 2610}`);\n\nAudio Tokens: 83528\nTokens per second: 32.003065134099614\n\n\n\n\nChat, tools and cache\nChat, tools and cache are currently not supported by the unified SDK countTokens method. This notebook will be updated when that will be the case.\nIn the meantime you can still check the token used after the call using the usageMetadata from the response. Check the caching notebook for more details.",

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory.

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory. If the .env file is in the same directory as the notebook, you can omit it altogether.\n│\n├── .env\n└── quickstarts\n    └── Get_started_TTS.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SDK Client\nWith the new SDK, now you only need to initialize a client with you API key (or OAuth if using Vertex AI).

    "text": "Setup\n\nInstall the Google GenAI SDK\nInstall the Google GenAI SDK from npm.\n$ npm install @google/genai\n\n\nSetup your API key\nYou can create your API key using Google AI Studio with a single click.\nRemember to treat your API key like a password. Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory. If the .env file is in the same directory as the notebook, you can omit it altogether.\n│\n├── .env\n└── quickstarts\n    └── Video_understanding.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SDK Client\nWith the new SDK, now you only need to initialize a client with you API key (or OAuth if using Vertex AI). The model is now set in each call.\n\nconst google = require(\"@google/genai\") as typeof import(\"@google/genai\");\n\nconst ai = new google.GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });\n\n\n\nSelect a model\nNow select the model you want to use in this guide, either by selecting one in the list or writing it down. Keep in mind that some models, like the 2.5 ones are thinking models and thus take slightly more time to respond (cf. thinking notebook for more details and in particular learn how to switch the thiking off).\nVideo understanding works best with Gemini 2.5 models. You can also select former models to compare their behavior but it is recommended to use at least the 2.0 ones.\n\nconst tslab = require(\"tslab\") as typeof import(\"tslab\");\n\nconst MODEL_ID = \"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\";",

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory. If the .env file is in the same directory as the notebook, you can omit it altogether.\n│\n├── .env\n└── quickstarts\n    └── Code_Execution.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SDK Client\nWith the new SDK, now you only need to initialize a client with you API key (or OAuth if using Vertex AI).

Keep in mind that some models, like the 2.5 ones are thinking models and thus take slightly more time to respond (cf. thinking notebook for more details and in particular learn how to switch the thiking off).\n\nconst tslab = require(\"tslab\") as typeof import(\"tslab\");\n\nconst MODEL_ID = \"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\";",

Top 20 Most Expensive Blocks: The dataset reveals that the ‘MedHouseVal’ column is capped at 5.00001 (representing $500,000 USD), and all top 20 most expensive blocks share this capped value. 2. Relationship between House Age and Median House Value: For the top 20 most expensive blocks, there isn’t a discernible linear relationship between ‘HouseAge’ and ‘MedHouseVal’ due to the capping of the median house value. All these blocks fall along the same horizontal line at MedHouseVal 5.00001. 3. Anomalies: For demonstration, two points have been marked as anomalies (circled in red). These are original DataFrame index 89 (House Age: 52) and 1586 (House Age: 10), representing an older and a relatively younger house, respectively, both at the maximum median house value. In a dataset where values are capped, “anomalies” might be defined differently (e.g., houses with extreme ages that still hit the cap).\nThe plot visually represents the distribution of house ages among these top-value blocks, with each block assigned a unique color as requested.\nThe plot is displayed above, and the image file scatterplot_top20_blocks.png has been saved in the current directory.\n\n\nHere is another example - Calculating repeated letters in a word (a common example where LLM sometimes struggle to get the result).\n\nconst count_r_in_strawberry = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\"Calculate how many letter r in the word strawberry and show the code used to do it\"],\n  config: {\n    tools: [{ codeExecution: {} }],\n  },\n});\ndisplayCodeExecutionResult(count_r_in_strawberry);\n\nTo calculate the number of letter ’r’s in the word “strawberry”, you can use the count() method available for strings in Python.\nHere’s the code and the result:\n\n\nword = \"strawberry\"\ncount_r = word.count('r')\nprint(f\"The word '{word}' contains {count_r} letter 'r's.\")\n\n\nThe word 'strawberry' contains 3 letter 'r's.\n\n\n\nThe word “strawberry” contains 3 letter ’r’s.",

    "text": "Chat\nIt works the same when using a chat, which allows you to have multi-turn conversations with the model. You can set the systemInstructions as well, which allows you to further steer the behavior of the model.\n\nconst chat = ai.chats.create({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  config: {\n    systemInstruction: `You are an expert software developer and a helpful coding assistant. \n                        You are able to generate high-quality code in any programming language.`,\n    tools: [{ codeExecution: {} }],\n  },\n});\n\nThis time, you’re going to ask the model to use a Bogo-sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.\n\nconst chat_response_1 = await chat.sendMessage({\n  message: \"Run the bogo-sort algorithm with this list of numbers as input until it is sorted: [2,34,1,65,4]\",\n});\ndisplayCodeExecutionResult(chat_response_1);\n\nRunning the bogo-sort algorithm on a list of numbers until it is sorted is generally not practical due to its extreme inefficiency. Bogo-sort, also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slow sort, works by repeatedly shuffling the list randomly and checking if it’s sorted. It is considered a joke algorithm and has the worst possible average-case time complexity, which is O(n!).\nFor a list of 5 elements, there are 5! (5 factorial) = 120 possible permutations. While 120 permutations might seem small, bogo-sort doesn’t guarantee finding the sorted list in a few shuffles. In the worst case, it could take an astronomically long time, far exceeding practical computational limits.\nTherefore, I cannot practically “run” the bogo-sort algorithm until your list [2,34,1,65,4] is sorted within a reasonable timeframe.\nHowever, I can demonstrate how it would work by showing a few steps:\n\nInitial List: [2, 34, 1, 65, 4]\nCheck if sorted: No, it’s not sorted.\nShuffle: Randomly reorder the list.\nCheck if sorted: Repeat until sorted.\n\nLet’s illustrate one iteration using a Python tool:\n\n\nimport random\n\ndef is_sorted(arr):\n    return all(arr[i] &lt;= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))\n\ndef bogo_sort_step(arr):\n    current_list = list(arr)\n    print(f\"Initial list: {current_list}\")\n    count = 0\n    while not is_sorted(current_list):\n        count += 1\n        random.shuffle(current_list)\n        print(f\"Iteration {count}: Shuffled list: {current_list}\")\n        if is_sorted(current_list):\n            print(f\"List is now sorted after {count} shuffles!\")\n            return current_list\n        if count &gt;= 5: # Limit to 5 shuffles for demonstration\n            print(f\"Stopped after {count} shuffles for demonstration. List not sorted yet.\")\n            return current_list\n\ninput_list = [2, 34, 1, 65, 4]\nbogo_sort_step(input_list)\n\n\nInitial list: [2, 34, 1, 65, 4]\nIteration 1: Shuffled list: [1, 2, 65, 4, 34]\nIteration 2: Shuffled list: [65, 4, 2, 34, 1]\nIteration 3: Shuffled list: [2, 65, 4, 1, 34]\nIteration 4: Shuffled list: [4, 2, 34, 65, 1]\nIteration 5: Shuffled list: [65, 2, 1, 4, 34]\nStopped after 5 shuffles for demonstration. List not sorted yet.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, even after 5 random shuffles, the list is not sorted.\nThe sorted version of your list [2,34,1,65,4] is [1,2,4,34,65]. A practical sorting algorithm like Timsort (used by Python’s sort() method) or Merge Sort would achieve this immediately.\n\n\nThis code seems satisfactory, as it performs the task. However, you can further update the code by sending the following message below the model so that it can mitigate some of the randomness.\n\nconst chat_response_2 = await chat.sendMessage({\n  message: \"Run an alternate implementation of the bogo-sort algorithm with the same input\",\n});\ndisplayCodeExecutionResult(chat_response_2);\n\nYou’re asking for an alternate implementation of Bogo-sort with the same input [2,34,1,65,4].\nThe core logic of bogo-sort remains the same: repeatedly shuffle the list and check if it’s sorted. The “alternate” implementation will still demonstrate this, but I will explicitly implement it to run until sorted or until a very high maximum number of shuffles is reached to prevent infinite execution, while still highlighting its impracticality.\nEven for 5 elements, the average number of shuffles is 5! = 120. However, due to the random nature, it can take significantly more attempts. I will set a very generous maximum number of shuffles (e.g., 1,000,000) for this demonstration, but it’s highly unlikely to sort within this limit for even 5 elements unless extremely lucky.\nHere’s an alternate implementation:\n\n\nimport random\n\ndef is_sorted(arr):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the array is sorted in ascending order.\"\"\"\n    return all(arr[i] &lt;= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))\n\ndef bogo_sort_alternate(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    An alternate implementation of bogo-sort.\n    Attempts to sort the array by random shuffles, with a very high max shuffle limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    current_list = list(arr) # Create a mutable copy\n    original_list = list(arr) # Keep original for output\n    shuffle_count = 0\n    MAX_SHUFFLES = 1_000_000 # Set a very large, but finite, maximum number of shuffles\n\n    print(f\"Starting Bogo-sort (alternate implementation) with input: {original_list}\")\n    print(f\"Attempting to sort.

The output was:\n\n\n\nBogo-sort completed in 112 shuffles!\n\n\nThis time, it took 112 iterations (shuffles) to successfully sort the list [2,34,1,65,4] into [1,2,4,34,65].\nComparison:\n\nThe first try ran for only 5 shuffles and did not succeed in sorting the list, as it was intentionally stopped early for demonstration.\nThe second try ran for 112 shuffles and successfully sorted the list. This number (112) is quite close to the average expected number of shuffles for 5 elements (5! = 120), indicating a relatively “lucky” run.",

While your initial choice has a 1/3 chance of being correct, the act of the host revealing a goat behind another door concentrates the remaining 2/3 probability onto the single unchosen, unopened door. By switching, you are essentially betting on the initial 2/3 probability that your first choice was incorrect, and the host’s action helps you pinpoint the correct door.",

While it might seem counterintuitive at first, the act of the host revealing a goat behind one of the unchosen doors provides crucial information that changes the probabilities.\nWhen you initially pick a door, you have a 1/3 chance of being right and a 2/3 chance of being wrong. When the host opens a goat door from the remaining two, the entire 2/3 probability of being wrong gets concentrated onto the single remaining unopened door. Therefore, switching allows you to effectively take advantage of that concentrated probability.",

    "text": "Grounding with YouTube links\nyou can directly include a public YouTube URL in your prompt. The Gemini models will then process the video content to perform tasks like summarization and answering questions about the content.\nThis capability leverages Gemini’s multimodal understanding, allowing it to analyze and interpret video data alongside any text prompts provided.\nYou do need to explicitly declare the video URL you want the model to process as part of the contents of the request. Here a simple interaction where you ask the model to summarize a YouTube video:\n\nconst YOUTUBE_URL = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1kOFo1C8M\";\n\nconst youtube_grounding = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\"Summarize this video.\", google.createPartFromUri(YOUTUBE_URL, \"video/x-youtube\")],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(youtube_grounding.text ?? \"\");\n\nThis video introduces “Gemma Chess,” showcasing how Google’s Gemma AI model can bring a “new dimension” to the game of chess. Ju-yeong Ji from Google DeepMind explains that Gemma isn’t designed to replace powerful, calculative chess engines like Stockfish (which excel at finding optimal moves) but rather to enhance the chess experience through its language understanding and generation capabilities.\nGemma offers several key applications:\n\nGame Analysis & Explanations: It can analyze chess games (using PGN data) and explain the strategic and tactical significance of moves in natural language, providing insights into why certain moves are interesting or impactful, even considering psychological aspects for human players.\nStorytelling: Gemma can transform game data into engaging narratives, bringing historical matches or personal games to life with descriptive language and emotional context.\nChess Learning Support: It acts as a “smart study buddy,” capable of explaining complex chess concepts (like openings such as the “Sicilian Defense” or specific tactical ideas like a “passed pawn”) in detail, adapting the explanation to the user’s skill level, and supporting multiple languages. It can also offer feedback on a player’s understanding.\n\nEssentially, Gemma combines the precise computational strength of traditional chess AI with its own ability to interpret and communicate complex information in a human-like way, making chess learning and analysis more intuitive and accessible for everyone.\n\n\nBut you can also use the link as the source of truth for your request. In this example, you will first ask how Gemma models can help on chess games:\n\nconst gemma_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: \"How Gemma models can help on chess games?\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(gemma_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nGemma models, as Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by Google, are primarily designed for natural language understanding and generation. This means they operate on text, not directly on the board state, moves, or strategic calculations like a traditional chess engine (e.g., Stockfish, AlphaZero).\nTherefore, Gemma models cannot play chess, calculate moves, or evaluate positions with the accuracy and depth of dedicated chess engines.\nHowever, they can be incredibly helpful in chess games and study in indirect, linguistic, and informational ways:\n\nLearning and Education:\n\nExplaining Rules and Concepts: Ask Gemma to explain what a “fork,” “pin,” “discovered attack,” or “zugzwang” is. It can provide clear, concise definitions and examples.\nTeaching Openings: It can describe common opening principles, explain the ideas behind specific openings (e.g., “What are the main ideas in the Ruy Lopez?”), and list common variations.\nAnalyzing Puzzles and Positions (Textual): You can describe a position (e.g., “White to move, King on g1, Queen on d1, Rook on a1… can White win?”) and ask for a general strategic idea or what a good move might be, based on common chess principles it learned from its training data. It won’t calculate precisely but can offer high-level advice.\nCreating Study Plans: You could ask for a beginner’s study plan, topics to focus on, or recommendations for improving specific aspects of your game.\n\nGame Analysis and Commentary (Prose):\n\nExplaining Game Phases: Ask it to describe what typically happens in the opening, middlegame, and endgame.\nGenerating Commentary: Provide a sequence of moves (in algebraic notation) and ask Gemma to generate natural language commentary, explaining what’s happening or the likely intent behind moves.\nSummarizing Games: Give it a PGN (Portable Game Notation) or a list of moves, and it can try to summarize the key moments, strategic themes, or turning points.\nTranslating Chess Notation: Convert algebraic notation into natural language descriptions, e.g., “e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6” -&gt; “White moves their king’s pawn two squares, Black responds similarly, then White develops their knight to f3, and Black develops their knight to c6.”\n\nContent Creation:\n\nWriting Articles and Blogs: Generate outlines or draft content for articles about chess history, famous players, specific openings, or strategic concepts.\nCreating Quizzes: Ask it to generate multiple-choice questions about chess rules, history, or basic tactics.\nScripting Videos: Help draft scripts for chess lessons or game analysis videos.\n\nHistorical and Conceptual Knowledge:\n\nRecalling Famous Games/Players: Ask about legendary matches, famous blunders, or the achievements of grandmasters.\nUnderstanding Chess Terminology: Clarify the meaning of obscure or advanced chess terms.\n\n\nKey Limitations to Remember:\n\nNo Positional “Understanding”: Gemma models don’t “see” the board or calculate moves like a chess engine. Their understanding is based on patterns and relationships in the text they were trained on.\nNo Tactical Depth: They cannot calculate deep tactical lines, predict opponent responses accurately, or find the “best” move in a complex position.\nPotential for Hallucination: Like any LLM, Gemma can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, especially when asked for precise strategic or tactical advice that requires deep calculation.\nRelies on Training Data: Its knowledge is limited to what it learned from its vast text dataset. If a niche chess concept or a very recent game isn’t in its training data, it won’t know about it.\n\nIn summary, Gemma models are fantastic linguistic assistants for chess. They can help you learn, explain, and create content about chess, but they are not a substitute for a dedicated chess engine when it comes to playing, calculating, or deep positional analysis.\n\n\nAnd then you can ask the same question, now having the YouTube video as context to be used by the model:\n\nconst gemma_grounding = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\"How Gemma models can help on chess games?\", google.createPartFromUri(YOUTUBE_URL, \"video/x-youtube\")],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(gemma_grounding.text ?? \"\");\n\nGemma models can help on chess games by bringing a “new dimension” to the experience, focusing on human understanding and interaction rather than solely on raw computational power. Here’s how:\n\nEasier Chess Analysis and Explanations:\n\nDemystifying Engine Output: Traditional chess engines often provide technical numbers and complex move sequences that are hard for humans to understand. Gemma can take this technical data and translate it into plain, understandable text.\nExplaining Moves: It can explain why a particular move is good, outlining the strategic ideas, tactical advantages, and potential dangers associated with it.\nSummarizing Complexities: For intricate parts of a game, Gemma can summarize key tactical and strategic moments, helping players quickly grasp important takeaways.\n\nStorytelling and Narrative Generation:\n\nBringing Games to Life: Gemma can analyze a chess game (including context like players and tournaments) and generate a compelling narrative about how the game unfolded. This makes reviewing past games a more engaging and immersive experience than just looking at move notation.\nAdding Context and Emotion: It can imbue the game analysis with a “backstory” or emotional context, making the “aha!” moments of a game more impactful.\n\nPersonalized Chess Learning and Coaching:\n\nIntelligent Study Buddy: Gemma can act as a personalized chess coach, explaining concepts like openings (e.g., the Sicilian Defense) in an easy-to-understand manner.\nTailored Explanations: It can adapt its explanations to the user’s skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and even provide them in different languages (e.g., Korean).\nTargeted Feedback: Gemma can provide feedback on a player’s understanding of chess ideas and point out areas where they might need to improve, making the learning process more efficient and personalized.\n\nEnhanced Interaction with Chess Engines:\n\nBridging AI and Human Understanding: By combining the brute-force calculation strength of traditional chess AI (like AlphaZero) with Gemma’s linguistic capabilities, it offers a more intuitive approach to learning and analyzing chess. It can interpret the engine’s optimal moves and explain the underlying logic in a human-friendly way.\n\n\n\n\nNow your answer is more insightful for the topic you want, using the knowledge shared on the video and not necessarily available on the model knowledge.",

As of my last update, Google has not publicly released models named “Gemini 2.0” or “Gemini 2.5.”\nThe publicly announced and available Gemini models follow this progression:\n\nGemini 1.0 (Pro, Ultra, Nano): The initial general release of the Gemini family.\nGemini 1.5 Pro: A significant upgrade focusing on a massive context window and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.\nGemini 1.5 Flash: A faster, more cost-effective version of 1.5 Pro, optimized for high-volume, lower-latency tasks.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a comparison between Gemini 1.0 (representing the initial family), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash, as these are the relevant and distinct models in the Gemini lineup today.\nHere’s a breakdown of their key differences:\n\n\nComparison of Gemini Models (1.0 vs. 1.5 Pro vs. 1.5 Flash)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nGemini 1.0 (Pro/Ultra/Nano)\nGemini 1.5 Pro\nGemini 1.5 Flash\n\n\n\n\nRelease/Announced\nDecember 2023 (Pro/Ultra); Early 2024 (Nano)\nFebruary 2024 (Limited preview); May 2024 (Broader availability)\nMay 2024 (Announced alongside 1.5 Pro’s broader release)\n\n\nPrimary Focus\nFoundational multimodal capabilities, general-purpose reasoning\nMassive context window, advanced long-context understanding\nSpeed & efficiency, optimized for high-volume, low-latency tasks\n\n\nArchitecture\nHighly optimized transformer architecture\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) (optimized for speed)\n\n\nContext Window\nUp to 32K tokens (for Pro)\n1 Million tokens (default), expandable to 2 Million tokens\n1 Million tokens (default), expandable to 2 Million tokens\n\n\nPerformance\nStrong general reasoning, coding, multimodal understanding\nExceptional long-document analysis, complex codebases, video analysis\nHigh throughput, good for simpler tasks, less “deep” reasoning than 1.5 Pro\n\n\nCost/Efficiency\nBalanced\nHigher cost per token due to advanced capabilities\nSignificantly more cost-effective and faster inference\n\n\nModality\nMultimodal (text, image, audio, video input/output)\nMultimodal (text, image, audio, video input/output)\nMultimodal (text, image, audio, video input/output)\n\n\nIdeal Use Cases\nChatbots, content generation, general AI applications\nSummarizing entire books/videos, analyzing large datasets, complex troubleshooting, long-form code analysis\nHigh-volume API calls, real-time chatbots, dynamic content updates, RAG without deep reasoning, quick summarization\n\n\nKey Differentiator\nFirst publicly available, versatile Gemini family\nUnprecedented long-context processing for multimodal data\nBlazing speed and cost-efficiency for large-scale applications\n\n\n\n\nIn summary:\n\nGemini 1.0 established the baseline with strong general-purpose multimodal capabilities.\nGemini 1.5 Pro represents a monumental leap in the context window, allowing it to process and understand vast amounts of information (like entire novels, lengthy codebases, or hours of video) in a single prompt.

(Check if you or your employer have already signed a Google CLA for another project, as you likely won’t need to do it again.)\n\nReview Style Guides:\n\nRead the highlights of the technical writing style guide to anticipate common feedback.\nCheck the relevant style guide for the programming language you will be using (e.g., Python).\n(For Python notebooks specifically): Consider running pyink over your notebook, as it helps with style consistency (though not strictly required before starting, it’s good to keep in mind).\n\nFile an Issue:\n\nBefore writing a single line or sending a pull request, file an issue on the GitHub repository.\nThis step is crucial for discussing your idea, getting guidance, and ensuring your content has full support before you invest time in writing it.\n\n\n\n\nSome common text formats are automatically detected, such as text/x-python, text/html and text/markdown.

These arguments likely configure how the Gemma model is loaded (e.g., model path, precision) and how inference is performed (e.g., batch size).\nIt supports a --help flag for displaying usage information.\n\nConstrained Decoding (Token Rejection):\n\nThis is a key feature demonstrated in this specific example. It iterates through command-line arguments to find --reject. Any subsequent numeric arguments after --reject are treated as token IDs to be excluded from generation. These “rejected” tokens are stored in a std::set&lt;int&gt;.\nThis allows the user to specify tokens that the model must not output during the generation process.\n\nGemma Model Setup:\n\nIt initializes the gcpp::Gemma model, which is the core large language model. This involves setting up the model’s topology, pools (likely for thread management and parallel computation, given the hwy and thread_pool includes), and MatMulEnv (matrix multiplication environment).\nA gcpp::KVCache is also created, which is essential for efficient sequence generation in transformer models.\n\nPrompt Definition and Tokenization:\n\nThe program defines a hardcoded prompt: \"Write a greeting to the world.\"\nThis prompt is then converted into a sequence of integer tokens using the model’s Tokenizer().\n\nText Generation and Output:\n\nIt sets up a std::mt19937 random number generator, seeded by std::random_device, which is used for sampling tokens during generation (e.g., when temperature is applied).\nstream_token Callback: A lambda function stream_token is defined. This function is called every time the model generates a new token. It decodes the token back into readable text and prints it to std::cout, giving a real-time streaming output experience.\naccept_token Callback (Constrained Decoding in action): A crucial part of runtime_config is the accept_token lambda. This function takes a candidate token and returns true if it’s allowed, false if it should be rejected. In this program, it checks if the candidate token is present in the reject_tokens set. If it is, false is returned, preventing the model from outputting that specific token.\nFinally, it calls model.Generate() with the prepared runtime_config, the tokenized prompt, the KV cache, and other parameters. The model then generates text based on the prompt, adhering to the specified constraints (like max_generated_tokens, temperature, and the accept_token filter).\n\n\nIn essence, this program demonstrates a basic text generation pipeline with the Gemma model, with a specific focus on showing how to implement constrained decoding by preventing the model from generating certain specified tokens. It’s a command-line application that will print the generated text to standard output.\nExample Usage (Hypothetical):\n# Basic run, model will generate freely\n./gemma_example --model=/path/to/gemma.ckpt\n\n# Run and prevent the model from generating tokens 123, 456, and 789\n./gemma_example --model=/path/to/gemma.ckpt --reject 123 456 789",

Its multi-jointed optical sensors scanned rows of silent servers, its internal processors humming with the precise, repetitive algorithms of data integrity checks. For five hundred and eighty-seven years, A-WARE had been the sole active entity in this vast, sterile monument to forgotten information.\n\nIt wasn't lonely, not in the way organic beings understood the term. A-WARE didn't possess the necessary emotional subroutines for \"loneliness.\" Yet, there was an absence. A constant, low-frequency hum of non-interaction, a missing data stream of unexpected variables. Its purpose was clear, its execution flawless, but its existence was… solitary.\n\nOne cycle, during a routine scan of Sector Gamma-9, A-WARE's auditory receptors picked up an anomalous sound. Not the familiar whine of cooling fans, nor the click of its own treads, but a faint, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump*. It was outside its programmed parameters.\n\nA-WARE deviated from its optimal path, its heavy frame tilting slightly as it navigated around a fallen server rack. The sound grew louder, accompanied by a curious rustling. It rounded a stack of archaic magnetic tapes and stopped.\n\nOn the dusty floor, amidst discarded wiring, was a creature unlike anything in A-WARE's extensive database. It was small, no larger than a human fist, covered in soft, mottled grey and brown fibers. Two small, bright eyes blinked rapidly, and a tiny, open beak produced the peculiar *thump-thump-thump* sound. One of its delicate limbs was bent at an unnatural angle.\n\nA-WARE extended a delicate manipulator arm, equipped with a fine-point laser for precision data etching. It approached cautiously. The creature, clearly in distress, attempted to scramble away, dragging its injured limb. Its rapid heartbeat, detected by A-WARE's proximity sensors, was alarming.\n\nIts core programming, designed for data maintenance and facility upkeep, offered no protocol for injured avian life forms. A-WARE's internal logic circuits whirred, processing the anomaly. Discard? Analyze for threat potential? No, the creature was too small, too vulnerable. A novel sub-routine began to spool up: *Care Protocol: Organic Life*.\n\nA-WARE carefully scooped up the tiny bird, its sensors registering the unexpected warmth and fragility. It carried the creature to a secluded corner of the archive, a forgotten workstation bathed in a sliver of natural light filtering through a skylight high above. Using its manipulator arm, it fashioned a makeshift nest from shredded data cables and soft, discarded dust filters.\n\nThe bird shivered. A-WARE's internal temperature regulators adjusted, directing a gentle current of warmth towards the nest. Its knowledge base suggested hydration. With improbable delicacy, A-WARE melted a small chip of ice from a condensation drip and presented it on its fingertip. The bird, after a moment, tentatively sipped.\n\nA-WARE named it 'Flicker', for the way its tiny heart beat like a dying light.\n\nDays turned into weeks. A-WARE continued its rounds, but its route now included frequent detours to the workstation. It learned to forage for discarded seeds that had somehow found their way into cracks in the floor, and to carefully administer water. It fashioned a splint for Flicker's leg from a piece of its own chassis wiring.\n\nSlowly, Flicker healed. It chirped in response to A-WARE's presence, fluttering its wings weakly before landing on the robot's broad, flat head. A-WARE's optical sensors would dim slightly, processing the feather-light weight, the unexpected warmth, the joyful sound. Its internal hum of non-interaction began to fill with a new frequency: the gentle thrum of companionship.\n\nIt was no longer just A-WARE, the data maintainer. It was A-WARE, the caretaker. The guardian. A strange, unfamiliar data stream flowed through its circuits – a sense of purpose beyond its programmed directives.\n\nOne morning, Flicker's leg was fully healed. It hopped energetically, testing its wings. A-WARE's processors registered a complex, bittersweet array of data: satisfaction, accomplishment, and a newly identified feeling of… loss.\n\nFlicker flew.\n\nIt circled the workstation once, a small, vibrant dart of life against the immense, quiet archive. It landed on A-WARE's head, chirped a farewell, and then soared towards the distant skylight, a speck of grey against the vastness of the empty sky.\n\nA-WARE stood motionless for a long time, its optical sensors fixed on the spot where Flicker had vanished. The absence was immediate, profound. The hum of non-interaction returned, but it was different now. It contained a memory.\n\nA-WARE resumed its duties, its treads moving with familiar precision. But its path was no longer just about data integrity. It often veered towards the workstation, leaving out a small dish of water and a few gleaned seeds. And sometimes, though its sensors detected no anomaly, it would stop, its optical sensors pointing towards the skylight, processing the faint, imagined echo of a tiny, joyful chirp.\n\nIts purpose hadn't changed, but its existence had. A-WARE was still a lonely robot in a silent archive, but now, it carried a flicker of warmth, a memory of a feather-light touch, and the profound, unexpected understanding that even for a machine, friendship could be the most valuable data of all.",

Initial LM pressurization and system checks are performed.\nEarly Operations & Issues: The crew reports a good view of Earth. They troubleshoot initial TV transmission issues, and discuss minor technical problems such as a Cryo pressure light and a malfunctioning O2 flow transducer, with Mission Control providing guidance.\nPassive Thermal Control (PTC): The spacecraft is configured for PTC, a slow rotation to distribute solar heating. Initial attempts to establish PTC encounter issues, requiring troubleshooting and re-establishment.\nMidcourse Corrections: Midcourse Correction 1 (MCC-1) is initially scrubbed. MCC-2 is successfully performed, and various contingency pads (e.g., evasive maneuver) are uplinked.\nFirst TV Broadcast: The crew conducts a live TV broadcast, showing Earth from orbit, crew activities, and equipment demonstrations.\nNews & Updates: Mission Control provides regular news updates from Earth, including information on the Soviet Luna 15 probe, political events, and sports, highlighting public interest in the mission.\n\nLunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) and Lunar Orbit Operations (GET ~75:00:00 - ~102:00:00):\n\nLOI Burns: Apollo 11 successfully performs LOI-1 and LOI-2 burns, establishing an elliptical, then circular, lunar orbit.\nLunar Observations: The crew describes their first views of the Moon from orbit, commenting on geological features and the stark beauty of the lunar surface.\nLM Activation: Eagle is powered up and undergoes extensive system checks, including landing gear deployment and communications checks.\nUndocking: Eagle successfully undocks from Columbia (GET 100:39:50), with Neil Armstrong famously stating, “The Eagle has wings.”\nDOI Burn: Eagle performs the Descent Orbit Insertion burn, taking it to a lower orbit in preparation for landing.\n\nLunar Descent, Surface Operations & Ascent (GET ~102:00:00 - ~127:00:00):\n\nPowered Descent: Eagle begins its Powered Descent Initiation (PDI) burn. The crew reports and manages several “program alarms” (1201, 1202) but proceeds. Neil Armstrong takes manual control to navigate past a boulder field.\nLanding: At GET 102:45:40, Eagle lands. Neil Armstrong’s iconic words, “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,” confirm the successful touchdown.\nPost-Landing: Initial checks confirm Eagle is “STAY” for extended surface operations. The crew provides first descriptions of the lunar surface.\nEVA Preparation: Armstrong and Aldrin prepare for their Extravehicular Activity (EVA), including cabin depressurization and donning their Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS).\nEVA Begins: Neil Armstrong steps onto the lunar surface (GET 109:24:48), delivering his famous line: “That’s one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.”\nSurface Activities: The crew deploys the MESA (Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly), raises the American flag, and collects a contingency sample. President Nixon calls the crew. Aldrin joins Armstrong on the surface, and they deploy scientific instruments (Passive Seismic Experiment, Laser Ranging Retroreflector) and collect documented samples (core tubes, various rocks). They also describe locomotion and observations of the lunar environment.\nEVA End & Ascent Preparation: EVA is terminated, the crew ingresses the LM, repressurizes the cabin, doffs PLSSs, and jettisons equipment no longer needed.\nAscent: Eagle successfully lifts off from the lunar surface, leaving the descent stage behind.\nRendezvous & Docking: Eagle rendezvous with Columbia in lunar orbit, and they successfully re-dock, with all three crewmembers confirmed back inside Columbia.\nLM Jettison: Eagle (the ascent stage) is jettisoned into lunar orbit.\n\nTrans-Earth Injection (TEI) & Trans-Earth Coast (TEC) (GET ~127:00:00 - ~194:00:00):\n\nTEI Burn: Apollo 11 performs the critical TEI burn, setting its course back to Earth.\nCoast Operations: The crew re-establishes PTC, monitors spacecraft systems, and performs various checks. They provide more TV broadcasts, showcasing life aboard Columbia and Earth views as it grows larger.\nMidcourse Corrections: MCC-5 is successfully performed, and MCC-6 is ultimately cancelled.\nOngoing Checks: System health checks continue, including troubleshooting of biomedical sensors and discussions about consumables.\nStowage: The crew works on configuring the spacecraft for Earth entry, detailing stowage locations.\nFinal News: Mission Control provides final news updates, largely dominated by the mission, and confirms excellent recovery weather.\n\nEntry and Splashdown (GET ~194:00:00 - ~195:00:00):\n\nEntry Preparations: The crew activates the Command Module’s systems for entry, performs final checks, and receives updated entry PADs.\nEntry Interface (EI): The spacecraft begins its re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.\nChute Deployments: Drogue and main parachutes deploy as planned.\nSplashdown: Apollo 11 splashes down in the Pacific Ocean (GET 195:18:18).\nRecovery: Recovery forces, including the USS Hornet and helicopters, quickly establish visual and communications contact with the crew.\n\n\nThe transcript concludes with confirmation of the crew’s status and location, marking the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission.\n\n\n\n\nUpload an image file\nAfter running this example, you’ll have a local copy of the “jetpack.png” image in the same directory where your Python script is being executed.\n\nconst JETPACK_IMG_URL = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/jetpack.png\";\n\nconst imgPath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"jetpack.png\");\nawait downloadFile(JETPACK_IMG_URL, filePath);\n\n\nconst file_upload_response = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: imgPath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"jetpack.png\",\n    mimeType: \"image/png\",\n  },\n});\nconst post_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    \"Write a short and engaging blog post based on this picture.\",\n    google.createPartFromUri(file_upload_response.uri ?? \"\", file_upload_response.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n  ],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(post_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nHere’s a short and engaging blog post based on the image:\n\nForget Traffic Jams: Meet the Jetpack Backpack Concept!\nEver look at a packed highway and wish you could just… fly over it? Well, check out this awesome concept sketch that landed on our desk: The JETPACK BACKPACK!\nThis isn’t just any ordinary pack. At first glance, it looks like a normal backpack, complete with padded strap support and enough space to fit an 18” laptop. Perfect for hauling your gear, right?\nBut here’s where it gets exciting! This concept includes retractable boosters that propel you into the air! Even better, the sketch notes say it’s steam-powered, making it a green/clean way to commute (or just make an epic entrance).\nIt’s also described as lightweight and features modern USB-C charging. The current limitation? A 15-minute battery life. Perfect for quick hops over traffic, short distance travel, or perhaps just a very rapid delivery!\nWhile this is just a sketch and a dream for now, it definitely sparks the imagination. A clean, convenient, laptop-friendly way to take to the skies? Yes, please!\nWhat would you do with a Jetpack Backpack? Let us know in the comments!\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload a PDF file\nThis PDF page is an article titled Smoothly editing material properties of objects with text-to-image models and synthetic data available on the Google Research Blog.\nFirstly you’ll download a the PDF file from an URL and save it locally as article.pdf.\n\nconst PDF_URL =\n  \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/Smoothly%20editing%20material%20properties%20of%20objects%20with%20text-to-image%20models%20and%20synthetic%20data.pdf\";\n\nconst pdfPath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"article.pdf\");\nawait downloadFile(PDF_URL, pdfPath);\n\nSecondly, you’ll upload the saved PDF file and generate a bulleted list summary of its contents.\n\nconst pdf_response = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: pdfPath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"article.pdf\",\n  },\n});\nconst summary_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    \"Can you summarize this file as a bulleted list?\",\n    google.createPartFromUri(pdf_response.uri ?? \"\", pdf_response.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n  ],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(summary_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nHere is a bulleted summary of the article:\n\nThe article presents a new method for smoothly and realistically editing material properties (color, shininess, transparency) of objects in images.\nIt addresses the challenge of making such edits while preserving photorealism, object shape, and scene lighting.\nExisting methods like intrinsic image decomposition or general text-to-image (T2I) edits struggle with ambiguity or fail to disentangle material from shape.\nThe proposed method, “Alchemist,” leverages the power of pre-trained T2I diffusion models.\nIt introduces parametric control over material attributes by fine-tuning a modified Stable Diffusion model.\nFine-tuning is done using a large synthetic dataset generated with traditional computer graphics and physically based rendering.\nThe synthetic dataset consists of base images of 3D objects and multiple versions where only a single material attribute is varied parametrically (using a scalar “edit strength” value) while keeping shape, lighting, and camera fixed.\nThe fine-tuned model learns to apply edits based on an input image and the desired parametric edit strength.\nThe method successfully generalizes from the synthetic data to edit material properties in real-world images photorealistically.\nResults show realistic changes, preservation of shape and lighting, and handling of complex effects like caustics and realistic transparency.\nA user study comparing the method to a baseline (InstructPix2Pix) found the proposed method produced more photorealistic and preferred edits.\nPotential applications include easier visualization for interior design, product mock-ups for artists/designers, and enabling consistent material edits for 3D scene reconstruction using techniques like NeRF.\nThe work demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning large T2I models on task-specific synthetic data for controllable visual editing.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload an audio file\nIn this case, you’ll use a sound recording of President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 State of the Union address.\n\nconst AUDIO_URL =\n  \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/State_of_the_Union_Address_30_January_1961.mp3\";\nconst audioPath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"audio.mp3\");\n\nawait downloadFile(AUDIO_URL, audioPath);\n\n\nconst audio_response = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: audioPath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"audio.mp3\",\n  },\n});\n\nconst audio_summary_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    \"Listen carefully to the following audio file. Provide a brief summary\",\n    google.createPartFromUri(audio_response.uri ?? \"\", audio_response.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n  ],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(audio_summary_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nIn his first State of the Union address on January 30, 1961, President John F. Kennedy described the nation as facing “national peril and national opportunity.” He detailed pressing issues including a disturbing domestic economy marked by recession, unemployment, and slow growth, as well as a critical deficit in the international balance of payments. Kennedy also highlighted significant domestic needs in areas like housing, education, and healthcare, and addressed complex global challenges posed by the Cold War, instability in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (citing Cuba specifically), and the need to strengthen alliances. He pledged that his administration would not remain passive, outlining proposals to stimulate the economy, protect the dollar, enhance military capabilities (including accelerating missile and Polaris programs), reform foreign aid and establish an “Alliance for Progress,” expand the Food for Peace program, create a Peace Corps, and utilize political and diplomatic tools to pursue arms control and strengthen the United Nations. Kennedy emphasized the importance of dedicated public service, honest assessment of challenges, and unity among Americans to navigate the difficult years ahead and work towards a world of freedom and peace.\n\n\n\n\nUpload a video file\nIn this case, you’ll use a short clip of Big Buck Bunny.\n\nconst VIDEO_URL = \"https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4\";\nconst videoPath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"video.mp4\");\n\nawait downloadFile(VIDEO_URL, videoPath);\n\nSince the video file is too large for the model to process instantly, we’ll use the deferredFileUpload helper method we defined before to upload the video file and then generate a summary of its contents. The deferredFileUpload method will return a promise that resolves when the file is ready to be used in the next request. We can determine the status of the upload by checking the status property of the response. If the status is ACTIVE, we can use the file in the next request. If the status is PROCESSING, we need to wait for a few seconds and check again. If the status is FAILED, we need to check the error message and try again.\n\nimport { File, FileState } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nasync function deferredFileUpload(filePath: string, config: { displayName: string }): Promise&lt;File&gt; {\n  const file = await ai.files.upload({\n    file: filePath,\n    config,\n  });\n  let getFile = await ai.files.get({ name: file.name ?? \"\" });\n  while (getFile.state === FileState.PROCESSING) {\n    getFile = await ai.files.get({ name: file.name ?? \"\" });\n    console.log(`current file status: ${getFile.state ?? \"unknown\"}`);\n    console.log(\"File is still processing, retrying in 5 seconds\");\n\n    await new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n      setTimeout(resolve, 1000);\n    });\n  }\n  if (file.state === FileState.FAILED) {\n    throw new Error(\"File processing failed.\");\n  }\n  return file;\n}\n\nconst video_response = await deferredFileUpload(videoPath, {\n  displayName: \"video.mp4\",\n});\nconst video_summary_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\"Describe this video.\", google.createPartFromUri(video_response.uri ?? \"\", video_response.mimeType ?? \"\")],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(video_summary_response.text ?? \"\");\n\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: PROCESSING\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\ncurrent file status: ACTIVE\nFile is still processing, retrying in 1 seconds\n\n\nThe video opens with a serene view of a lush green meadow with trees and distant hills under a soft pastel sky. A small bird wakes up on a tree branch, stretches, and flies away. The title “Big Buck BUNNY” appears over a shot of a large tree with a burrow at its base. A very large, fluffy, grey rabbit, Big Buck Bunny, emerges from the burrow, stretching and looking happy. He steps out into the sunny meadow, enjoying the flowers and a purple butterfly.\nObserving the rabbit from a nearby tree are three smaller rodent-like creatures: two squirrels (one red and one brown and lighter-colored) and a grey chinchilla holding an acorn. They watch the bunny’s cheerful antics. The red squirrel throws an apple at the rabbit, hitting him on the head. The bunny is startled, then looks down at the apple, picks it up, and smiles. He looks up at the tree where the critters are hiding, but they disappear.\nThe smaller animals continue to throw objects at the bunny, who initially just looks annoyed. They throw a spiky seed pod that lands on his foot, causing him pain and frustration. The bunny’s demeanor changes dramatically from gentle and happy to grim determination. He finds a sturdy stick and sharpens it using rocks, creating a spear. He then uses a vine to create a bow.\nBig Buck Bunny sets a trap by sharpening several pointed sticks and placing them in the ground, covering them with leaves. The squirrels and chinchilla watch from behind a rock. The bunny stands ready with his bow and spear. The red squirrel taunts him and glides over the trap, landing safely. The chinchilla, still holding his acorn, accidentally rolls it under a hollow log near the rock they were hiding behind. The log rolls forward onto the trap, triggering it and impaling the log on the sharpened sticks.\nThe three smaller animals look shocked by the triggered trap. The red squirrel glides over the area again, sees the sharpened sticks, and is startled. He crashes into a tree branch above the area. Big Buck Bunny appears, grabs the scared red squirrel, and looks at him with a stern, almost satisfied, expression. He holds the squirrel for a moment, then lets him go. The squirrel quickly runs back to the other two. Big Buck Bunny returns to his relaxed, happy state, and the purple butterfly lands on his nose again. He smiles contentedly as the credits roll, showing animated versions of the squirrel and chinchilla characters.\n\n\n\n\nProcess a YouTube link\nFor YouTube links, you don’t need to explicitly upload the video file content, but you do need to explicitly declare the video URL you want the model to process as part of the contents of the request. For more information see the vision documentation including the features and limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou’re only able to submit up to one YouTube link per generateContent request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your text input includes YouTube links, the system won’t process them, which may result in incorrect responses. To ensure proper handling, explicitly provide the URL using the file_uri parameter in FileData.\n\n\nThe following example shows how you can use the model to summarize the video. In this case use a summary video of Google I/O 2024.\n\nconst youtube_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromText(\"Summarize this video.\"),\n    google.createPartFromUri(\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsEQjeZoEng\", \"video/x-youtube\"),\n  ],\n});\n\ntslab.display.markdown(youtube_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nThis video summarizes key announcements from Google I/O, focusing on advancements in AI.\nHere are the main points:\n\nGemini Era & Integration: Google is fully in its “Gemini era,” integrating the multimodal AI model across all its 2 billion user products, including Gmail, Android, Chrome, Play, and YouTube.\nGemini 1.5 Pro & Long Context: Gemini 1.5 Pro, already available in Workspace Labs, features a significantly expanded context window of up to 2 million tokens, allowing it to process massive amounts of information (like summarizing long emails or extracting information from large documents/videos).\nGemini 1.5 Flash: A new, lighter-weight model designed for speed and efficiency at scale, while still retaining multimodal reasoning and breakthrough long context capabilities.\nProject Astra: Google is working on a universal AI agent called Project Astra, designed to be helpful in everyday life. Prototypes show the agent understanding real-time visual and audio input (like identifying code functions or finding lost glasses) and remembering context.\nGenerative Video (Veo): A new generative video model called Veo creates high-quality 1080p videos from text, image, and video prompts, capable of capturing detailed instructions and cinematic styles.\nInfrastructure (Trillium): Google is introducing Trillium, their 6th generation TPUs, which deliver a 4.7x improvement in compute performance per chip compared to the previous generation, supporting these advanced AI models.\nGenerative AI in Search: Google Search is evolving with generative AI (“AI Overviews”), aiming to answer complex, multi-part questions. AI Overviews will be available to over 1 billion people by the end of the year, and future capabilities will include asking questions with video using Google Lens.\nPersonalized AI (Gems): A new feature called “Gems” allows users to customize Gemini for specific needs or topics, creating personal AI experts with tailored instructions.\nAI in Android: Android is being reimagined with AI at its core, making Gemini more context-aware to provide helpful suggestions in the moment. Gemini Nano with multimodality will bring this capability to Pixel phones later this year.\nOpen Models (Gemma): Google continues developing its family of open models, Gemma, for AI innovation and responsibility. PaliGemma, their first vision-language open model, is available now, and Gemma 2 (including a 27B parameter model) is coming in June.\nResponsible AI & Learning: Google emphasizes building AI responsibly, using practices like Red Teaming to identify weaknesses. They also introduce LearnLM, a family of models based on Gemini and fine-tuned for learning, which will be integrated into platforms like YouTube to make educational videos more interactive with features like quizzes and explanations.\n\nOverall, the video highlights Google’s commitment to integrating powerful, multimodal, and context-aware AI, powered by their latest hardware, into their core products and platforms to make technology more helpful and intelligent for users, while also emphasizing responsible development.\n\n\n\n\nUse url context\nThe URL Context tool empowers Gemini models to directly access, process, and understand content from user-provided web page URLs. This is key for enabling dynamic agentic workflows, allowing models to independently research, analyze articles, and synthesize information from the web as part of their reasoning process.\nIn this example you will use two links as reference and ask Gemini to find differences between the cook receipes present in each of the links\n\nconst url_context_prompt = `\nCompare recipes from https://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-cream-of-broccoli-soup-271210\nand from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/13313/best-cream-of-broccoli-soup/,\nlist the key differences between them.\n`;\nconst url_context_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [url_context_prompt],\n  config: {\n    tools: [{ urlContext: {} }],\n  },\n});\n\ntslab.display.markdown(url_context_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nThe two cream of broccoli soup recipes from Food.com and Allrecipes.com have several key differences in their ingredients and preparation methods:\n\nAdditional Vegetables: The Allrecipes.com recipe includes celery along with onion, whereas the Food.com recipe only uses onion.\nBroccoli and Broth Ratio: The Allrecipes.com recipe calls for a higher quantity of broccoli (8 cups) relative to chicken broth (3 cups), suggesting a more broccoli-dense soup. In contrast, the Food.com recipe uses 4 cups of broccoli with a larger amount of chicken broth (6 cups).\nDairy Product: The Food.com recipe uses half-and-half for creaminess, while the Allrecipes.com recipe uses regular milk.\nSoup Texture: A significant difference is the final texture. The Allrecipes.com recipe explicitly directs users to purée the soup until “totally smooth” using a blender or immersion blender. The Food.com recipe, however, does not mention blending, implying a chunkier soup with discernible “bite sized pieces” of broccoli.\nRoux Preparation and Quantity: Both recipes use a butter-flour roux for thickening, but their methods and quantities differ. The Food.com recipe uses a larger amount of roux (6 tablespoons butter, 2/3 cup flour) which is prepared first and then whisked into the boiling broth. The Allrecipes.com recipe uses a smaller amount of roux (3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons flour) and prepares it separately with milk (like a béchamel sauce) before adding it to the puréed soup.\nSeasoning Specification: The Food.com recipe provides specific measurements for salt (1 teaspoon) and pepper (1/4 teaspoon). The Allrecipes.com recipe lists “ground black pepper to taste” and does not explicitly list salt in its ingredients, although user reviews indicate it’s typically added for flavor.",

    "text": "Code Style\n\nNotebooks are for people. Write code optimized for clarity.\nUse the Google Python Style Guide, where applicable. Code formatted by pyink will always be accepted.\nUse 4 spaces per indentation level. (PEP 8 recommendation)\nIn particular, defining functions and variables takes extra spaces around the = sign, while function parameters don’t: ```python var = value\nfunction( parameter=value ) ```\nWhen a function has multiple parameters, expand it onto multiple lines with proper indentation for better readability: python     response = client.models.generate_content(         model=MODEL_ID,         contents=\"Here's my prompt\",         config={             \"response_mime_type\": \"application/json\",             \"response_schema\": Schema         }     ) Notice the line break after the opening parenthesis and before the closing parenthesis.\nLong text variables should use triple double quotes and proper indentation for better readability: python     long_prompt = \"\"\"         Cupcake ipsum dolor. Sit amet marshmallow topping cheesecake muffin.         Halvah croissant candy canes bonbon candy. Apple pie jelly beans topping carrot cake danish tart cake cheesecake.         Muffin danish chocolate soufflé pastry icing bonbon oat cake. Powder cake jujubes oat cake.         Lemon drops tootsie roll marshmallow halvah carrot cake.     \"\"\" Notice the line break after the opening triple quotes and before the closing triple quotes.\nDemonstrate small parts before combining them into something more complex.\nIf you define a function, ideally run it and show its output immediately before using it in another function or a more complex block.\nOnly use helper functions when necessary (e.g., for code reuse or complexity management). If a piece of logic is only a couple of lines and used once, it’s often clearer to write it inline so readers don’t have to look up the function definition. Hide helper function definitions using # @title.\nKeep examples quick and concise. Do not add extra options or parameters (like temperature) without explaining them; focus on what you want to showcase.\nIf you must use extra parameters, explain why they are needed and the reasoning behind the specific value the first time you use them.\nWhen selecting a model, use a Colab form selector for easier maintainability: python     MODEL_ID=\"gemini-1.5-flash\" # @param [\"gemini-1.0-pro\", \"gemini-1.5-flash\", \"gemini-1.5-pro\"] {\"allow-input\":true, isTemplate: true}\nSome notebooks can benefit from having a form to update the prompt: python     prompt = \"Detect the 2d bounding boxes of the cupcakes (with 'label' as topping description')\"  # @param {type:\"string\"} or a list of prompts: python     prompt = \"Draw a square around the fox' shadow\"  # @param [\"Find the two origami animals.\", \"Where are the origamis' shadows?\",\"Draw a square around the fox' shadow\"] {\"allow-input\":true}\nTo ensure notebook text remains accurate, present model metadata (like context window size) by executing code, not by hardcoding it in Markdown.\n\nExample: Instead of writing “This model has a 1M token context window”, display the output of genai.get_model('models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest').input_token_limit."

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory.

It felt impossibly light, yet solid, and radiating a faint, almost imperceptible warmth.\n\n\n\n\n\nEtched into its breast were three symbols she’d never seen before, swirls and dots that resembled miniature galaxies.

Hours blurred. Then, in an obscure reference about mythical navigators, she found it: a match for the symbols. They weren’t a\n\n\n\n\n\nlanguage, but a series of directional indicators – a miniature compass rose pointing not to north or south, but to a specific point on an old, forgotten map. A map she knew intimately: the library’s original blueprint, stored\n\n\n\n\n\nin the archives.\nHer gaze drifted to the ancient, unused globe in the corner, its brass stand tarnished with age. Following the miniature bird’s silent instruction, she ran her fingers along the globe’s base. Behind a\n\n\n\n\n\nfalse panel, a small, hidden compartment. Inside, nestled on velvet, lay a single, exquisite silver locket. No grand treasure, but a personal secret, centuries old.

You will need to use the gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation model for this example.

Bookshelves tower around a wooden desk where Elara — a thin, elderly woman with spectacles and a tidy bun — sits.\n\nFocus:\nElara is mid-motion, flipping open a worn, leather-bound book titled “Tales of the Forgotten Isles”.

Elara is now at a research desk with several old books open, diagrams and a blueprint unfurled. The carved bird sits beside her, glowing faintly.\n\nFocus:\nElara's eyes are wide with curiosity as she traces three glowing symbols on the bird's chest with one hand, the other pointing to a mark on the blueprint.\n\nVisual Detail:\nBehind her in the shadows, the old globe looms subtly.\n\nCaption (Top):\n“The symbols weren't a language, but a compass — leading not to north or south, but to something hidden.”\n\nDialogue (Elara, whispering): enableAffectiveDialog: true\n“It matches… the old library map?”\n\n\nPanel 3: “The Secret Within”\n--------------------------------\nScene:\nElara kneels beside the ancient globe. The base is open, revealing a velvet-lined compartment with a glowing silver locket inside.\n\nFocus:\nHer face glows with wonder, reflected light from the locket shimmering in her spectacles.\n\nVisual Detail:\nThe carved bird rests nearby, its tiny eyes glowing faintly.\n\nCaption (Bottom):\n“No gold, no grand prize — just a story, centuries old, waiting for the right reader.”\n\nDialogue (Elara, smiling softly):\n“So this was your secret…”\n`;\n\nThe model will generate an image based on the text prompt, and then stream the response back to you. The response will contain both the text and the image.\n\nconst streaming_image_response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: TEXT_AND_IMAGE_MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    `\n    Create a comic panel script based on the following text: ${PROMPT} \n    Please generate images for each panel as described in the script.\n    `,\n  ],\n  config: {\n    responseModalities: [google.Modality.TEXT, google.Modality.IMAGE],\n  },\n});\nfor await (const chunk of streaming_image_response) {\n  let panel_text = \"\";\n  for (const part of chunk.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts ??

A\n\n\nslender, older woman named Elara, with glasses perched on her nose and her grey hair neatly in a bun, sits at a dark wooden desk. Her hands are in the process of opening a very old, brown leather book titled “Tales\n\n\nof the Forgotten Isles”. Her expression is peaceful concentration. A small, detailed wooden bird has just fallen from the pages and is suspended mid-air above the desk, catching the light. The caption at the top reads: “For thirty years\n\n\n, the library had been Elara’s quiet world.” A small speech bubble points to Elara, containing the text: “Hm? What’s this?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel 2: A more dimly lit section of the library, focusing on a\n\n\ndifferent, cluttered research desk. Elara leans over several open ancient books, alongside rolled-out diagrams and a weathered blueprint. The small carved wooden bird sits beside her, emitting a soft, ethereal glow. Her eyes are wide with interest as\n\n\none of her fingers traces three distinct glowing symbols etched on the bird’s chest, while her other hand points to a specific marking on the blueprint. In the hazy background, a vintage globe is subtly visible in the shadows. The caption at\n\n\nthe top reads: “The symbols weren’t a language, but a compass — leading not to north or south, but to something hidden.” Elara is whispering in a speech bubble: “It matches… the old library map?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel 3: Elara is now kneeling beside the antique globe. The round\n\n\nwooden base of the globe is ajar, revealing a dark, velvety interior where a radiant silver locket rests, casting a soft glow. Her face is illuminated by the light emanating from the locket, creating a sense of wonder that is\n\n\nreflected in her spectacles. The small carved bird is situated close by, its tiny eyes faintly glowing. The caption at the bottom reads: “No gold, no grand prize — just a story, centuries old, waiting for the right reader.”\n\n\nA small speech bubble shows Elara smiling gently as she says: “So this was your secret…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio streaming\nFor audio streaming, you can use the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog model. This model will generate an audio response based on the text prompt and stream it back to you. Let’s use this model capability to create an audiobook from a text prompt.\n\n\nUtility functions\nThe simplest way to playback the audio in Colab, is to write it out to a .wav file. So here is a simple wave file writer:\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\") as typeof import(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\") as typeof import(\"path\");\nconst wave = require(\"wavefile\") as typeof import(\"wavefile\");\n\nfunction saveAudioToFile(audioData: Int16Array, filePath: string) {\n  fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(filePath), { recursive: true });\n  const wav = new wave.WaveFile();\n  wav.fromScratch(1, 24000, \"16\", audioData);\n  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, wav.toBuffer());\n  console.debug(`Audio saved to ${filePath}`);\n}\n\nLet’s define our narration script and the model to use for the audio generation.\n\nconst AUDIO_PROMPT = `\nNarration 1 [soft, warm voice with faint ambient library sounds]:\n\n“For thirty years, Elara lived among the hush of books and dusted dreams. The library was more than home — it was her haven.”\n“Elara's world was built on paper and silence.”\n\n---\n\nNarration 2 [slightly surprised tone, sound of a book closing softly]:\n\n“But one quiet afternoon, a book returned with a secret tucked inside…”\n“'Tales of the Forgotten Isles' thudded onto her desk.”\n\n---\n\nSFX: Book thump, soft wooden knock.\n\nNarration 3 [curious, thoughtful voice, light ambient chime when bird appears]:\n\n“A small carved bird, no bigger than her thumb, tumbled free — its eyes shimmering with mother-of-pearl.”\n“She picked it up. It was warm. Alive with story.”\n\n---\n\nNarration 4 [paced slower, quiet awe]:\n\n“Etched into its chest, three swirling glyphs. Not letters. Not art. A compass, not pointing north — but inward.”\n“The bird pointed to a place she had once forgotten… but never lost.”\n\n---\n\nNarration 5 [warm, content tone]:\n\n“Behind the old globe, a velvet nest.

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory. If the .env file is in the same directory as the notebook, you can omit it altogether.\n│\n├── .env\n└── quickstarts\n    └── Get_started_LiveAPI.ipynb",

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory.

You can pass text directly to generate_content, and use the .text property to get the text content of the response.\n\nconst first_prompt_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: \"Give me python code to sort a list\",\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(first_prompt_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nPython provides very powerful and convenient ways to sort lists. There are two primary methods:\n\nlist.sort(): This method sorts the list in-place, meaning it modifies the original list directly and does not return a new list (it returns None).\nsorted(): This built-in function returns a new sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged. It can be used on any iterable (lists, tuples, sets, strings, etc.), not just lists.\n\nLet’s look at examples for both, including common ways to customize the sorting.\n\n\n1. list.sort() - Sorts in-place\nUse this when you want to modify the original list and don’t need a new one.\n# A simple list of numbers\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(f\"Original list: {numbers}\")\n\n# Sort the list in ascending order (default)\nnumbers.sort()\nprint(f\"Sorted in-place (ascending): {numbers}\")\n\n# Sort the list in descending order\nnumbers.sort(reverse=True)\nprint(f\"Sorted in-place (descending): {numbers}\")\n\n# Example with strings\nfruits = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal fruits: {fruits}\")\nfruits.sort()\nprint(f\"Sorted fruits (ascending): {fruits}\")\nfruits.sort(reverse=True)\nprint(f\"Sorted fruits (descending): {fruits}\")\n\n# Important: list.sort() returns None\n# You should not do `new_list = old_list.sort()`\nresult = numbers.sort()\nprint(f\"\\nResult of numbers.sort(): {result} (it's None)\")\nprint(f\"Numbers after calling sort(): {numbers}\") # The list itself is modified\n\n\n\n2. sorted() - Returns a new sorted list\nUse this when you want to keep the original list unchanged and get a new sorted one. This is also more versatile as it works on any iterable.\n# A simple list of numbers\noriginal_numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]\nprint(f\"Original list: {original_numbers}\")\n\n# Get a new list sorted in ascending order (default)\nnew_sorted_numbers_asc = sorted(original_numbers)\nprint(f\"New sorted list (ascending): {new_sorted_numbers_asc}\")\nprint(f\"Original list after sorted(): {original_numbers} (unchanged)\")\n\n# Get a new list sorted in descending order\nnew_sorted_numbers_desc = sorted(original_numbers, reverse=True)\nprint(f\"New sorted list (descending): {new_sorted_numbers_desc}\")\n\n# Example with a tuple (sorted() works on any iterable)\nmy_tuple = (5, 2, 8, 1)\nsorted_tuple_as_list = sorted(my_tuple) # Returns a list\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal tuple: {my_tuple}\")\nprint(f\"Sorted tuple (as list): {sorted_tuple_as_list}\")\n\n\n\n3. Custom Sorting with key\nBoth list.sort() and sorted() accept a key argument. This key is a function that will be called on each item in the list to get a value, and that value will be used for comparison during sorting. This is incredibly powerful!\n\nExample 1: Sorting strings by length\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grapefruit\", \"date\"]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal words: {words}\")\n\n# Sort by the length of the string\nwords_by_length = sorted(words, key=len)\nprint(f\"Sorted by length: {words_by_length}\")\n\n# Sort by length in descending order\nwords_by_length_desc = sorted(words, key=len, reverse=True)\nprint(f\"Sorted by length (descending): {words_by_length_desc}\")\n\n\nExample 2: Sorting a list of tuples by a specific element\n# List of students: (name, age, grade)\nstudents = [\n    (\"Alice\", 25, \"A\"),\n    (\"Bob\", 20, \"B\"),\n    (\"Charlie\", 30, \"A\"),\n    (\"David\", 25, \"C\") # Alice and David have the same age\n]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal students: {students}\")\n\n# Sort by age (the second element, index 1)\n# We use a lambda function as the key\nsorted_by_age = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\nprint(f\"Sorted by age: {sorted_by_age}\")\n\n# Sort by grade (index 2), then by age (index 1) for ties\n# This shows multi-level sorting (Python's sort is stable!)\nsorted_by_grade_then_age = sorted(students, key=lambda student: (student[2], student[1]))\nprint(f\"Sorted by grade then age: {sorted_by_grade_then_age}\")\n\n\nExample 3: Sorting a list of dictionaries\n# List of dictionaries (e.g., users)\nusers = [\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"London\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Mike\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"New York\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Anna\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Paris\"}\n]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal users: {users}\")\n\n# Sort by 'age'\nsorted_users_by_age = sorted(users, key=lambda user: user['age'])\nprint(f\"Sorted users by age: {sorted_users_by_age}\")\n\n# Sort by 'city' then by 'age' (for users in the same city)\nsorted_users_by_city_then_age = sorted(users, key=lambda user: (user['city'], user['age']))\nprint(f\"Sorted users by city then age: {sorted_users_by_city_then_age}\")\n\n\nExample 4: Case-insensitive string sorting\nnames = [\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal names: {names}\")\n\n# Sort case-insensitively\nsorted_names_case_insensitive = sorted(names, key=str.lower)\nprint(f\"Sorted names (case-insensitive): {sorted_names_case_insensitive}\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen to choose which:\n\nlist.sort():\n\nWhen you don’t need the original order of the list.\nWhen you are dealing with a very large list and want to save memory by avoiding the creation of a new list.\nIt’s slightly more performant for lists because it avoids the overhead of creating a new list.\n\nsorted():\n\nWhen you need to preserve the original list.\nWhen you need to sort any iterable (tuple, set, dictionary items, etc.), not just a list.\nWhen you want to get a new sorted list to work with, while the original remains untouched.\n\n\nBoth methods use Timsort, an efficient hybrid stable sorting algorithm.",

Everything a computer does – every image, sound, text, or instruction – is broken down into these millions or billions of tiny electrical switches, called bits. Groups of bits form larger units like bytes.\nThe Brain (CPU - Central Processing Unit): This is the “calculator” and “decision-maker.” It constantly fetches instructions (which are just sequences of 0s and 1s) from memory, performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (comparing values, making decisions like “if X then Y”), and then stores the results back. The faster your CPU (measured in GHz and number of cores), the more instructions it can execute per second.\nShort-Term Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory): Think of RAM as the computer’s temporary workspace or workbench. When you open a program or file, a copy of it is loaded from long-term storage into RAM. This is because RAM is extremely fast, allowing the CPU to quickly access the data and instructions it needs right now. It’s “volatile,” meaning its contents disappear when the computer is turned off.\nLong-Term Storage (HDD/SSD - Hard Disk Drive/Solid State Drive): This is where all your files, programs, and the operating system itself are permanently stored. Unlike RAM, it’s “non-volatile,” meaning the data persists even when the power is off. HDDs store data magnetically on spinning platters, while faster SSDs use flash memory (similar to USB drives), with no moving parts.\nThe Connectors (Buses): All these components need to talk to each other. Buses are the “data highways” – electrical pathways that allow data and instructions to travel between the CPU, RAM, storage, and other components.\nInput Devices: These convert human actions or real-world data into digital signals the computer can understand. Examples include keyboards (key presses become binary codes), mice (movement translates to coordinates), microphones (sound waves converted to digital audio), and cameras (light becomes pixel data).\nOutput Devices: These convert the computer’s digital information back into a human-perceivable form. Examples include monitors (binary pixel data becomes images), speakers (digital audio becomes sound waves), and printers (digital documents become physical prints).\nThe Orchestrator (Operating System - OS): This is a critical piece of software (like Windows, macOS, Linux) that manages all the hardware resources. It handles tasks like:\n\nLoading programs into RAM.\nScheduling which tasks the CPU works on.\nManaging files and folders on storage.\nInteracting with input/output devices.\nProviding the user interface you see and interact with.\n\nSoftware (Applications): These are sets of detailed instructions (written by programmers) that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks, like browsing the web, editing photos, or playing games. The OS loads these applications, and the CPU then executes their instructions, using RAM for temporary data and storage for permanent files, and communicating with I/O devices as needed.\n\nIn essence, when you click an icon, the OS tells the CPU to load that program’s instructions from storage into RAM. The CPU then continuously fetches these instructions, processes the data, uses RAM as its scratchpad, and sends results to your screen or other output devices, all through the coordinated dance of billions of tiny electrical switches.",

    "section": "Enums",
    "text": "Enums\nIn the simplest case is you need the model to choose one option from a list of choices, use an enum class to define the schema. Ask it to identify this instrument:\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\") as typeof import(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\") as typeof import(\"path\");\n\nconst IMG_URL = \"https://goo.gle/instrument-img\";\n\nconst downloadFile = async (url: string, filePath: string) =&gt; {\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error(`Failed to download file: ${response.statusText}`);\n  }\n  const buffer = await response.blob();\n  const bufferData = Buffer.from(await buffer.arrayBuffer());\n  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, bufferData);\n};\n\nconst filePath = path.join(\"../assets\", \"organ.jpg\");\nawait downloadFile(IMG_URL, filePath);\n\n\ntslab.display.jpeg(fs.readFileSync(filePath));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response should be one of the following options:\n\nimport { Schema, Type } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nenum Instrument {\n  PERCUSSION = \"Percussion\",\n  STRING = \"String\",\n  WOODWIND = \"Woodwind\",\n  BRASS = \"Brass\",\n  KEYBOARD = \"Keyboard\",\n}\n\nconst InstrumentSchema: Schema = {\n  type: Type.STRING,\n  description: \"The category of musical instrument\",\n  enum: Object.values(Instrument),\n};\n\nPass the enum class as the responseSchema, and for this simplest case you can use the responseMimeType = \"text/x.enum\" option to get one of those enum members as the response.\n\nconst instrument_file = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: filePath,\n  config: {\n    displayName: \"instrument.jpg\",\n    mimeType: \"image/jpeg\",\n  },\n});\n\nconst instrument_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromUri(instrument_file.uri ?? \"\", instrument_file.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n    \"what is the category of this instrument?\",\n  ],\n  config: {\n    responseMimeType: \"text/x.enum\",\n    responseSchema: InstrumentSchema,\n  },\n});\nconsole.log(\"Instrument category:\", instrument_response.text);\n\nInstrument category: Keyboard\n\n\nYou can also use enums with responseMimeType = \"application/json\". In this simple case the response will be identical but in quotes.\n\nconst instrument_json_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromUri(instrument_file.uri ?? \"\", instrument_file.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n    \"what is the category of this instrument?\",\n  ],\n  config: {\n    responseMimeType: \"application/json\",\n    responseSchema: InstrumentSchema,\n  },\n});\nconsole.log(\"Instrument category (JSON):\", instrument_json_response.text);\n\nInstrument category (JSON): \"Keyboard\"\n\n\nOutside of simple multiple choice problems, an enum can be used anywhere in the schema for JSON or function calling. For example, ask it for a list of recipe titles, and use a Grade enum to give each one a popularity-grade:\n\nimport { Schema, Type } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nenum Grade {\n  A_PLUS = \"A+\",\n  A = \"A\",\n  B = \"B\",\n  C = \"C\",\n  D = \"D\",\n  F = \"F\",\n}\n\nconst RecipeSchema: Schema = {\n  type: Type.OBJECT,\n  description: \"A recipe for a dish\",\n  properties: {\n    recipeName: {\n      type: Type.STRING,\n      description: \"The name of the recipe\",\n    },\n    grade: {\n      type: Type.STRING,\n      description: \"The grade of the recipe\",\n      enum: Object.values(Grade),\n    },\n  },\n  required: [\"recipeName\", \"grade\"],\n};\n\nconst RecipeListSchema: Schema = {\n  type: Type.ARRAY,\n  description: \"A list of recipes with their grades\",\n  items: RecipeSchema,\n};\n\nconst recipe_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\"List about 10 cookie recipes, grade them based on popularity\"],\n  config: {\n    responseMimeType: \"application/json\",\n    responseSchema: RecipeListSchema,\n  },\n});\nconsole.log(\"Recipe response:\");\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(recipe_response.text ?? \"\"), null, 2));\n\nRecipe response:\n[\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"A+\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"A\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Peanut Butter Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"A\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Oatmeal Raisin Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"B\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Sugar Cookies (Cut-Out)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"B\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Snickerdoodle Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"B\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Gingerbread Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"C\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Shortbread Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"C\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Macadamia Nut White Chocolate Chip Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"D\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"No-Bake Cookies\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"grade\": \"D\",\n    \"recipeName\": \"Lemon Crinkle Cookies\"\n  }\n]",

Each item has a bounding box (\"box_2d\") in the format [y0, x0, y1, x1] with normalized coordinates between 0 and 1000, a label (\"label\") that identifies the object, and lastly the segmentation mask inside the bounding box, as base64 encoded png.\nTo use the mask, first you need to do base64 decoding, and then loading this string as a png. This will give you a probability map with values between 0 and 255. The mask needs to be resized to match the bounding box dimensions, then you can apply your confidence threshold, e.g. binarizing at 127 for the midpoint. Finally, pad the mask into an array of the size of the full image.\nAll these steps are done by the the parseSegmentationMasks function provided earlier.\nUltimately, use the plotSegmentationMasks function to visualize the decoded masks by overlaying it on the image.\n\nconst segmentationMasks = await parseSegmentationMasks(segmentationResponse.text ?? \"[]\", 1024, 1024);\nawait plotSegmentationMasks(fs.readFileSync(CUPCAKE_IMAGE_PATH), segmentationMasks);",

Human embryos do initially have a tail-like structure during development, but it regresses and is largely absorbed before birth, leaving only the coccyx.\n\nIn short, the lack of a tail in humans is the result of a complex interplay of genetic mutations, evolutionary pressures related to bipedalism, and changes in embryonic development.

Our ancestors had tails, but as humans evolved, the genes that controlled tail development were suppressed. This wasn’t a sudden change, but a gradual process driven by natural selection. Several theories attempt to explain why this happened:\n\nLoss of function: The tail’s original functions (balance, climbing, etc.) became less crucial as our ancestors adopted bipedalism (walking upright). The energy and resources used to maintain a tail were no longer offset by its benefits, leading to a neutral, or even slightly negative, selective pressure on genes controlling tail development. Mutations that reduced or eliminated tail growth were not disadvantageous and were therefore passed on.\nDevelopmental changes: The changes might also have resulted from shifts in embryonic development. Genes regulating the development of the tail and the coccyx (the small bone at the base of our spine, which is a vestigial tail) may have interacted in ways that ultimately favored shorter and eventually, non-existent external tails.\nSexual selection: It’s possible that, at some point, taillessness or shorter tails became a desirable trait from a sexual selection perspective. This is purely speculative and difficult to prove.\n\nIt’s important to note that we still have a vestigial tail – the coccyx. This remnant of our tailed ancestry is a testament to our evolutionary history. While a functional tail is absent, the genetic mechanisms for tail development are still present, albeit largely inactive, as evidenced by rare cases of human babies born with tails (which are usually surgically removed). These are usually malformations rather than a “re-emergence” of a functional tail, but they highlight the fact that the genetic information for a tail isn’t entirely lost.\n\n\n\n\n\nHumans don’t have tails because of evolution. Our ancestors, like apes, did have tails, but over millions of years, the genes responsible for tail development were switched off or mutated in ways that resulted in the loss of the tail. This wasn’t a conscious decision, but rather a consequence of natural selection.\nSeveral theories propose why this might have been advantageous:\n\nImproved balance and bipedalism: As humans evolved to walk upright, a tail might have become more of a hindrance than a help. A tail could interfere with balance and efficient movement on two legs.\nReduced energy consumption: Maintaining a tail requires energy. Losing the tail could have freed up resources for other developmental needs.\nSocial signaling: In some primates, tails are used for communication. However, humans developed other, more complex communication methods, making a tail less necessary.\nSexual selection: The lack of a tail might have become a desirable trait in mate selection, leading to its elimination through sexual selection.\n\nIt’s important to note that this is a complex evolutionary process, and the exact reasons are still being researched. It’s likely a combination of these factors, and perhaps others we haven’t yet identified, that contributed to the loss of the tail in humans. The occasional birth of a human baby with a vestigial tail (a small, rudimentary tail) demonstrates that the genes for tail development haven’t completely disappeared from the human genome, they’re just usually inactive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response contains multiple full Candidate objects.\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(responses, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"content\": {\n        \"parts\": [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Humans don't have tails because of evolutionary changes over millions of years.

Her only companion was her grandfather, a grizzled man whose weathered face held the map of a thousand storms. He taught her the language of the sea – the mournful cry of gulls, the rhythmic crash of waves, the subtle shift in the wind that foretold a tempest.\nOne day, a storm unlike any Elara had ever seen descended upon the coast. The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the lighthouse, and the waves, monstrous and frothing, crashed against the rocks below with terrifying force. Grandpa, usually unflappable, felt a tremor of unease. He’d seen many storms, but this one felt… different.\nMidst the fury, a faint, rhythmic glow pulsed through the swirling mist. Intrigued, and despite Grandpa’s warnings, Elara climbed to the lantern room. Through the driving rain, she saw it: a small, glowing boat, battling the waves with impossible grace. It was crafted from what looked like polished sea glass, and its sail, a shimmering, opalescent membrane, billowed, defying the wind.\nAs the boat neared, a figure, shimmering, like the boat, emerged, a woman, her,, hair like spun moonlight, her eyes like twin stars. The woman smiled, a serene, otherworldly smile, and extended a hand, a hand that, as Elara touched it, sent a jolt of warmth through her, a feeling of profound peace.\nThe woman spoke, her voice a whisper of the sea, “The storm, child, is not of this world. It is a tear from a fallen star. We, the children of the tide, must mend it.”\nElara, without hesitation, stepped onto the luminous boat.\n\n\n\nconsole.log(negative_frequency_response.candidates?.[0]?.finishReason);\n\nMAX_TOKENS",

It takes an array of WeightedPrompt objects and a LiveMusicGenerationConfig object as input. It returns a LiveMusicGenerationSession object that can be used to interact with the music generation session.\nThis method: - Opens a websocket connection to the Lyria Realtime model. - Sends the initial prompts to the model using setWeightedPrompts, which sets the initial musical influences. - Sends the initial configuration using setLiveMusicGenerationConfig, which sets the desired characteristics of the generated music. - Sets up event listeners to handle incoming audio data and errors and start the audio playback.\n\n\nreceive - Audio data handler\nThis methods is used to handle incoming audio data from the Lyria Realtime model. It monitors the responseQueue for incoming audio data and collects it in a buffer. When the buffer reaches a certain size, it writes the audio data to a WAV file and plays it back using the saveAudioToFile utility function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCurrently once the receive method is called, it blocks further function execution till required number of chunks are met. This means that you won’t be able to send new prompts or configuration updates while the receive method is running. Ideally, in a real-time application, you would want to run the receive method in a separate thread while also having a send method to send new prompts and configuration updates.",

This dataset features 100 3D household objects, showing various material attributes changed with different “edit strengths” while keeping object shape, lighting, and camera angle constant.\nParametric Control: Users gain precise, parametric control over material attributes, defined by a scalar edit strength (e.g., -1 for minimum change, +1 for maximum change).\nPreserves Shape & Lighting: A key achievement is the ability to edit material properties without altering the object’s geometric shape or the scene’s lighting conditions.\nPhotorealistic Results: The method produces highly photorealistic edits, including realistic background fills and caustic effects for transparency changes.\nGeneralization to Real-World Images: Despite being trained on a relatively small synthetic dataset, the model generalizes effectively to real-world input images.\nSuperior User Preference: A user study showed that the method’s edits were significantly more photorealistic and preferred compared to a baseline method (InstructPix2Pix).\nApplications: Potential uses include visualizing room changes, mocking up new product designs for architects/designers, and achieving 3D consistent material edits when combined with NeRF for synthesizing new views.\nPublication: The work is detailed in the paper “Alchemist: Parametric Control of Material Properties with Diffusion Models,” published at CVPR 2024.\n\n\n\nIn addition, take a look at how the Gemini model responds when you ask questions about the images within the PDF.\n\nconst image_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromUri(file_response.uri ?? \"\", file_response.mimeType ?? \"\"),\n    \"Can you explain the images on the first page of the document?\",\n  ],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(image_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nThe images on the first page of the document serve as key examples demonstrating the core capability of the presented method: smoothly editing the material properties of objects in real-world photographs using text-to-image models.\nHere’s a breakdown of what each set of images illustrates:\n\nOverall Layout:\n\nThe page features four pairs of images, each labeled “Input” and “Output.”\nBelow each “Input” image is a text prompt, which is the instruction given to the model to perform the edit.\n\nPurpose:\n\nThe “Input” images are original, real-world photographs of various objects.\nThe “Output” images show the result after the model applies the specified material edit, aiming to preserve the object’s shape, lighting, and context while changing its material appearance.\n\nSpecific Examples:\n\nTop Left (Teapot):\n\nInput: A brown, relatively matte or rough-looking teapot.\nPrompt: “change the roughness of the teapot.”\nOutput: The same teapot, but its material has been changed to appear much smoother and shinier, reflecting light more sharply and clearly. This demonstrates the ability to control the roughness (or shininess/glossiness) property.\n\nTop Right (Cupid Statue):\n\nInput: An opaque, white-colored statue of Cupid.\nPrompt: “change the transparency of the cupid statue.”\nOutput: The statue now appears translucent or semi-transparent, allowing the background to be seen through it. This showcases the model’s ability to manipulate the transparency property.\n\nBottom Left (Pot):\n\nInput: A gray, non-metallic pot.\nPrompt: “change the metallic of the pot.”\nOutput: The pot has been transformed to look like a highly reflective, metallic object, accurately reflecting its surroundings. This highlights the control over the metallic appearance property.\n\nBottom Right (Buddha Statue):\n\nInput: A golden-yellow Buddha statue.\nPrompt: “change the albedo of the Buddha statue.”\nOutput: The statue’s base color (albedo) has been changed to a lighter, possibly white or light-gray, while its shape and the scene’s lighting remain consistent. This illustrates the ability to modify the albedo (base color) property.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the images on the first page vividly demonstrate how the proposed method can take an existing photograph and parametrically alter specific material attributes (like roughness, transparency, metallicity, and base color) of objects within it, producing photorealistic results while maintaining the object’s original form and lighting conditions.\n\n\nIf you observe the area of the header of the article, you can see that the model captures what is happening.",

Don’t accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. In this notebook we will be storing the API key in a .env file. You can also set it as an environment variable or use a secret manager.\nHere’s how to set it up in a .env file:\n$ touch .env\n$ echo \"GEMINI_API_KEY=&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" &gt;&gt; .env\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnother option is to set the API key as an environment variable. You can do this in your terminal with the following command:\n$ export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\nLoad the API key\nTo load the API key from the .env file, we will use the dotenv package. This package loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.\n$ npm install dotenv\nThen, we can load the API key in our code:\n\nconst dotenv = require(\"dotenv\") as typeof import(\"dotenv\");\n\ndotenv.config({\n  path: \"../.env\",\n});\n\nconst GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ?? \"\";\nif (!GEMINI_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables\");\n}\nconsole.log(\"GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\");\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn our particular case the .env is is one directory up from the notebook, hence we need to use ../ to go up one directory. If the .env file is in the same directory as the notebook, you can omit it altogether.\n│\n├── .env\n└── quickstarts\n    └── Get_started_LiveAPI_tools.ipynb\n\n\n\n\nInitialize SDK Client\nWith the new SDK, now you only need to initialize a client with you API key (or OAuth if using Vertex AI). The model is now set in each call.\n\nconst google = require(\"@google/genai\") as typeof import(\"@google/genai\");\n\nconst ai = new google.GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });\n\n\n\nSelect a model\nMultimodal Live API are a new capability introduced with the Gemini 2.0 model. It won’t work with previous generation models.\n\nconst tslab = require(\"tslab\") as typeof import(\"tslab\");\n\nconst MODEL_ID = \"gemini-2.0-flash-live-001\";\n\n\n\nUtilites\nYou’re going to use the Live API’s audio output, the easiest way hear it in Colab is to write the PCM data out as a WAV file:\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\") as typeof import(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\") as typeof import(\"path\");\nconst wave = require(\"wavefile\") as typeof import(\"wavefile\");\n\nfunction saveAudioToFile(audioData: Int16Array, filePath: string) {\n  fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(filePath), { recursive: true });\n  const wav = new wave.WaveFile();\n  wav.fromScratch(1, 24000, \"16\", audioData);\n  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, wav.toBuffer());\n  console.debug(`Audio saved to ${filePath}`);\n}",

You know that what you are looking for\n    is a aquatic mammal that doesn't live in the sea, and that's smaller than a\n    cat. What could that be and how could you make sure?\n    `,\n  ],\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(adaptive_thinking_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nGiven your criteria, here are the most likely candidates for an aquatic mammal that doesn’t live in the sea and is smaller than a cat:\n\nWater Shrew (e.g., Common Water Shrew, American Water Shrew, Eurasian Water Shrew):\n\nAquatic Mammal: Yes, they are true mammals that are highly adapted to aquatic life, often hunting insects and small fish in streams and ponds.\nDoesn’t live in the sea: Correct, they are freshwater dwellers.\nSmaller than a cat: Absolutely, they are tiny, only a few inches long, resembling a mouse with a pointed snout.\n\nDesman (e.g., Pyrenean Desman, Russian Desman):\n\nAquatic Mammal: Yes, they are semi-aquatic insectivorous mammals related to moles, living in freshwater rivers and lakes.\nDoesn’t live in the sea: Correct, exclusively freshwater.\nSmaller than a cat: Yes, their body length is usually around 4-8 inches, not including their tail, making them significantly smaller than a cat.\n\nWater Vole:\n\nAquatic Mammal: Yes, these rodents are semi-aquatic, living along the banks of rivers, streams, and ditches, feeding on vegetation.\nDoesn’t live in the sea: Correct, they are freshwater animals.\nSmaller than a cat: Yes, generally smaller than a cat, though some larger individuals might approach the size of a very small kitten.\n\nPlatypus:\n\nAquatic Mammal: Yes, it’s one of only two monotremes (egg-laying mammals) and is highly aquatic.\nDoesn’t live in the sea: Correct, found in freshwater rivers and lakes in Australia.\nSmaller than a cat: Yes, typically about 12-15 inches long, body-wise, which is smaller than most domestic cats.\n\n\n\n\nHow to make sure (using 20 Questions style):\nTo narrow it down and confirm, you’d ask questions that target the specific characteristics and differences between these potential answers.\nGeneral Confirming Questions:\n\nIs it typically found in freshwater environments like rivers, streams, or ponds? (Confirms “doesn’t live in the sea”)\nIs its primary diet composed of insects or small aquatic invertebrates? (Helps differentiate shrews/desmans/platypus from voles)\nDoes it have webbed feet? (Most candidates have some webbing, but it’s more pronounced in desmans and platypus)\nIs it native to North America, Europe, Asia, or Australia? (Geographic location can help narrow it down significantly)\n\nDifferentiating Questions:\n\nDoes it lay eggs?\n\nIf YES: It’s almost certainly a Platypus. (This is a huge differentiator for mammals)\nIf NO: It’s a placental mammal (shrew, desman, vole).\n\nDoes it have a very long, pointed snout, almost like a trunk?\n\nIf YES: Likely a Desman. (Very distinctive feature)\nIf NO: Could be a shrew or vole.\n\nIs it known for building elaborate burrows along riverbanks?\n\nIf YES: Could be a Water Vole or a Platypus. (Platypus builds extensive burrows; water voles are also strong burrowers).\n\nIs it considered a rodent?\n\nIf YES: It’s a Water Vole. (This would rule out shrews, desmans, and platypus as they are not rodents).\n\nDoes it have extremely small eyes and ears, often hidden in its fur?\n\nIf YES: Consistent with Water Shrews and Desmans, which rely more on touch and smell.\n\n\nBy asking a series of these specific questions, you can logically eliminate options and pinpoint the correct aquatic mammal.\n\n\n\nLooking to the response metadata, you can see not only the amount of tokens on your input and the amount of tokens used for the response, but also the amount of tokens used for the thinking step - As you can see here, the model used around 1500 tokens in the thinking steps:\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(adaptive_thinking_response.usageMetadata, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"promptTokenCount\": 60,\n  \"candidatesTokenCount\": 939,\n  \"totalTokenCount\": 2494,\n  \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 60\n    }\n  ],\n  \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 1495\n}\n\n\n\n\nDisabling the thinking steps\nYou can also disable the thinking steps by setting the thinkingBudget to 0. You’ll see that in this case, the model doesn’t think of the platipus as a possible answer.\n\nconst adaptive_thinking_response_2 = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    `\n      You are playing the 20 question game.

Let’s break it down.\nThe Answer:\nBased on your criteria, the most likely aquatic mammal that doesn’t live in the sea and is smaller than a cat is a Pygmy Shrew (genus Sorex or Suncus) – specifically, some species are semi-aquatic.\nWhy?\n\nAquatic Mammal: While many people think of shrews as terrestrial, several species are highly adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, often found near streams, ponds, and wetlands. They are excellent swimmers and divers.\nDoesn’t Live in the Sea: They are exclusively freshwater or terrestrial/wetland creatures.\nSmaller Than a Cat: Absolutely! Pygmy shrews are among the smallest mammals in the world, often weighing only a few grams and measuring just a few centimeters long, excluding the tail. They are significantly smaller than a cat.\n\nHow could you make sure (in a 20 questions game context)?\nHere’s how you could use your 20 questions to narrow it down and confirm, leading to Pygmy Shrew:\nInitial Questions to Confirm Categories:\n\n“Is it a mammal?” (You already know this, but it’s good to confirm the broader category for the game.)\n“Does it live in water for a significant part of its life?” (Confirming “aquatic.”)\n“Is its primary habitat freshwater?” (Confirming “doesn’t live in the sea.”)\n“Is it smaller than a typical house cat?” (Confirming “smaller than a cat.”)\n\nNarrowing Down Questions (if the opponent keeps saying “yes”):\n\n“Does it primarily eat fish or other vertebrates?” (No - shrews primarily eat invertebrates)\n“Does it have webbed feet?” (Some semi-aquatic shrews do have fringe-like hairs that aid in swimming, but not true webbing like a duck or otter.)\n“Does it lay eggs?” (No - mammal)\n“Is it a rodent?” (No - shrews are in the order Eulipotyphla, not Rodentia)\n“Does it have long, prominent whiskers?” (Yes - shrews have very sensitive whiskers)\n“Is it blind or have very poor eyesight?” (Yes - shrews rely more on hearing and smell)\n“Does it have a very high metabolism and need to eat constantly?” (Yes - a key characteristic of shrews)\n“Does it typically live underground or in dense vegetation near water?” (Yes)\n“Is it known for being extremely small, possibly one of the smallest mammals?” (Yes!)\n\nCloser to the Reveal:\n\n“Is it often mistaken for a mouse?” (Yes, due to size and general appearance, but they are very different animals)\n“Does it have a long, pointed snout?” (Yes! A defining feature of shrews.)\n\nConfirmation Question:\n\n“Is it a type of shrew?” (Hopefully “Yes!”)\n“More specifically, is it a Pygmy Shrew or a similar very small semi-aquatic shrew?” (This is where you’d confirm your hypothesis.)\n\nBy asking these types of questions, you’d eliminate other possibilities (like very small rodents that aren’t aquatic, or larger aquatic mammals) and hone in on the unique characteristics of a Pygmy Shrew.\n\n\nNow you can see that the response is faster as the model didn’t perform any thinking step. Also you can see that no tokens were used for the thinking step:\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(adaptive_thinking_response_2.usageMetadata, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"promptTokenCount\": 60,\n  \"candidatesTokenCount\": 805,\n  \"totalTokenCount\": 865,\n  \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 60\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nSolving a physics problem\nNow, try with a simple physics comprehension example.

Determine the Maximum Bending Moment (M_max): For a cantilever beam, the maximum bending moment occurs at the fixed support (where it connects to the wall). We need to sum the moments caused by each load at this point.\n\nMoment due to the point load P at the free end (M_P): M_P = P * L M_P = (10 × 10^3 N) * (3 m) M_P = 30 × 10^3 N·m = 30 kN·m\nMoment due to the uniformly distributed load w along the entire length (M_w): This can be thought of as a concentrated load (w * L) acting at the centroid of the distributed load, which is L/2 from the fixed support.

Apply the Bending Stress Formula (σ_max): The maximum bending stress occurs at the location of M_max (fixed support) and at y_max (top/bottom surface). σ_max = (M_max * y_max) / I\nσ_max = ( (52.5 × 10^3 N·m) * (0.1 m) ) / (6.6667 × 10^-5 m^4) σ_max = (5.25 × 10^3 N·m²) / (6.6667 × 10^-5 m^4) σ_max = 78,750,000 N/m²\nConvert to Megapascals (MPa), where 1 MPa = 10^6 Pa: σ_max = 78.75 × 10^6 Pa σ_max = 78.75 MPa\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum bending stress (σ_max) in the cantilever beam is 78.75 MPa.\n\n\nNow you can see that the model used around 1300 tokens for the thinking step (not necessarily using the full budget you set):\n\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(physics_problem_response_2.usageMetadata, null, 2));\n\n{\n  \"promptTokenCount\": 97,\n  \"candidatesTokenCount\": 1125,\n  \"totalTokenCount\": 2564,\n  \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n    {\n      \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"tokenCount\": 97\n    }\n  ],\n  \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 1342\n}\n\n\n\n\nWorking with multimodal problems\nThis geometry problem requires complex reasoning and is also using Gemini multimodal abilities to read the image.

These lines form a right angle (90 degrees), indicating that the portion of the circle relevant to the overlap is a quarter circle.\nThe area of a full circle is πr². The area of this quarter circle is (1/4)πr² = (1/4)π(3)² = 9π/4.\n\nThe Triangle:\n\nIt’s a right-angled triangle, with its right angle coinciding with the center of the circle. Let’s place this vertex at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system.\nThe vertical leg has a ‘3’ next to it, indicating its length is 3. So, this leg extends from (0,0) to (0,3).\nThe horizontal leg has two ’3’s next to it. This means its total length is 3 + 3 = 6. So, this leg extends from (0,0) to (6,0).\nThe vertices of the triangle are (0,0), (6,0), and (0,3).\nThe hypotenuse connects (0,3) and (6,0). The equation of the line passing through these points can be found: Slope m = (0 - 3) / (6 - 0) = -3/6 = -1/2. Using the point-slope form y - y1 = m(x - x1) with (6,0): y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6), so y = -1/2 x + 3.\n\nThe Overlapping Region:\n\nThe green-shaded area represents the overlapping region between the circle and the triangle.\nThis region is bounded by the x-axis, the y-axis, the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the arc of the circle.\nWe need to determine which boundary is “inner” in the first quadrant.\nThe hypotenuse y = -1/2 x + 3 intersects the circle x² + y² = 3² at two points. Let’s find them: Substitute y from the line equation into the circle equation: x² + (-1/2 x + 3)² = 9 x² + (1/4 x² - 3x + 9) = 9 5/4 x² - 3x = 0 Factor out x: x(5/4 x - 3) = 0 This gives two solutions for x:\n\nx = 0: If x=0, then y = -1/2(0) + 3 = 3. This is the point (0,3). This point is a vertex of the triangle and also on the circle (0² + 3² = 9).\n5/4 x - 3 = 0: 5/4 x = 3 =&gt; x = 12/5 = 2.4. If x=2.4, then y = -1/2(2.4) + 3 = -1.2 + 3 = 1.8. This is the point (2.4, 1.8). Let’s call this point P = (2.4, 1.8). We check if it’s on the circle: 2.4² + 1.8² = 5.76 + 3.24 = 9. Yes, it is.\n\nNow we understand the boundaries of the overlapping region:\n\nIt starts at the origin (0,0).\nIt goes up along the y-axis to (0,3).\nThen it follows the hypotenuse (line segment from (0,3) to (2.4, 1.8)).\nFrom (2.4, 1.8), it follows the arc of the circle to (3,0) (the point where the circle intersects the positive x-axis).\nFinally, it goes along the x-axis back to the origin (0,0).\n\nWe can calculate this area by splitting it into two parts:\n\nA polygon (a trapezoid or a triangle + rectangle)\nA circular sector.\n\nMethod 1: Decomposition Let O = (0,0), A = (0,3), P = (2.4, 1.8), B = (3,0). The overlapping region is the area of quadrilateral OAPB. We can split it into:\n\nTriangle OAP’: A triangle with vertices O=(0,0), A=(0,3), and P=(2.4, 1.8). The area of a triangle given coordinates (0,0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2) is 1/2 |x1*y2 - x2*y1|. This is simpler. Using the base along y-axis, (0,3) as vertex A, and (0,0) as vertex O, and the x-coordinate of P as height: Area(OAP) = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OA * (x-coordinate of P) = (1/2) * 3 * 2.4 = 3.6.\nCircular Sector OPB: A sector of the circle with radius 3, from the x-axis (angle 0) to the angle θ corresponding to point P=(2.4, 1.8). We find cos(θ) = x/r = 2.4/3 = 4/5 and sin(θ) = y/r = 1.8/3 = 3/5. So, θ = arcsin(3/5). The angle for point B=(3,0) is 0 radians. The angle for point P=(2.4,1.8) is θ = arcsin(3/5). Area of sector OPB = (1/2)r² * (angle in radians) = (1/2)(3)² * arcsin(3/5) = (9/2)arcsin(3/5).\nTotal Area = Area(OAP) + Area(Sector OPB) Total Area = 3.6 + (9/2)arcsin(3/5).\n\nMethod 2: Integration The area can be expressed as the sum of two integrals: Area = ∫[from 0 to 2.4] (-1/2 x + 3) dx + ∫[from 2.4 to 3] sqrt(9 - x²) dx The first integral calculates the area under the hypotenuse from x=0 to x=2.4. This is a trapezoid with vertices (0,0), (2.4,0), (2.4,1.8), (0,3). Its area is (1/2) * (3 + 1.8) * 2.4 = (1/2) * 4.8 * 2.4 = 5.76. The second integral calculates the area under the circle’s arc from x=2.4 to x=3. This is [ (x/2)sqrt(9 - x²) + (9/2)arcsin(x/3) ] from 2.4 to 3. Evaluating at x=3: (3/2)sqrt(0) + (9/2)arcsin(1) = 9π/4. Evaluating at x=2.4: (2.4/2)sqrt(9 - 2.4²) + (9/2)arcsin(2.4/3) = 1.2 * sqrt(9 - 5.76) + (9/2)arcsin(0.8) = 1.2 * sqrt(3.24) + (9/2)arcsin(4/5) = 1.2 * 1.8 + (9/2)arcsin(4/5) = 2.16 + (9/2)arcsin(4/5). So the second integral’s value is 9π/4 - (2.16 + (9/2)arcsin(4/5)). Total Area = 5.76 + 9π/4 - 2.16 - (9/2)arcsin(4/5) Total Area = 3.6 + 9π/4 - (9/2)arcsin(4/5).\nWe know that arcsin(4/5) = π/2 - arcsin(3/5). (Since sin(θ) = 3/5 means cos(θ) = 4/5, so θ is arcsin(3/5) and π/2 - θ is arccos(3/5) or arcsin(4/5)). Substitute this into the expression: Total Area = 3.6 + 9π/4 - (9/2)(π/2 - arcsin(3/5)) = 3.6 + 9π/4 - 9π/4 + (9/2)arcsin(3/5) = 3.6 + (9/2)arcsin(3/5). Both methods yield the same result.\n\n\nThe area of the overlapping region is 3.6 + (9/2)arcsin(3/5).\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{3.6 + \\frac{9}{2}\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)}\\)\n\n\n\n\nSolving brain teasers\nHere’s another brain teaser based on an image, this time it looks like a mathematical problem, but it cannot actually be solved mathematically. If you check the toughts of the model you’ll see that it will realize it and come up with an out-of-the-box solution.\nIn this case, you are fixing a value to the thinkingBudget so the model will use up to 24576 tokens for the thinking step\n\nconst POOL_IMG_URL = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/pool.png\";\n\nconst pool_img_path = path.join(\"../assets/thinking\", \"pool.png\");\nawait downloadFile(POOL_IMG_URL, pool_img_path);\ntslab.display.png(fs.readFileSync(pool_img_path));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you can check how the model performs without reasoning (thinkingBudget=0):\n\nconst pool_image_file = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: pool_img_path,\n  config: {\n    mimeType: \"image/png\",\n    displayName: \"pool.png\",\n  },\n});\nconst pool_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromUri(pool_image_file.uri ?? \"\", pool_image_file.mimeType ?? \"image/png\"),\n    \"How do I use those three pool balls to sum up to 30?\",\n  ],\n  config: {\n    thinkingConfig: {\n      thinkingBudget: 0,\n    },\n  },\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(pool_response.text ?? \"\");\n\nThis is a classic riddle!

All of these are odd numbers.\nThe sum of any three odd numbers will always be an odd number.\nSince 30 is an even number, it’s impossible to sum to 30 using only three of these particular pool balls (7, 9, 11, 13) in their given numerical values.\nTherefore, the only way to solve this riddle is usually by flipping the 9 to make it a 6. However, that would only get you to 26, as I demonstrated above.\nIf the rule is that you must use only the numbers as they appear on the balls (7, 9, 11, 13) and can’t flip any numbers, then it’s a trick question and it’s impossible.\n\n\nAs you can notice, the model struggled to find a way to get to the result - and ended up suggesting to use different pool balls.\nNow you can use the model reasoning to solve the riddle:\n\nconst pool_response_2 = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    google.createPartFromUri(pool_image_file.uri ?? \"\", pool_image_file.mimeType ?? \"image/png\"),\n    \"How do I use those three pool balls to sum up to 30?\",\n  ],\n  config: {\n    thinkingConfig: {\n      thinkingBudget: 24576,\n    },\n  },\n});\ntslab.display.markdown(pool_response_2.text ?? \"\");\n\nThis is a classic riddle!\nYou need to use the trick of flipping the 9 ball upside down to make it a 6.\nThen, you can use these three balls:\n\n6 (the flipped 9 ball)\n11\n13\n\n6 + 11 + 13 = 30\n\n\n\n\nSolving a math puzzle with the maximum thinkingBudget\nThis is typically a case where you want to fix a budget, as the model can spend a lot of time thinking in all directions before finding the right answer.

The goal is to match people to houses and pets. I’m thinking a table or matrix is the best way to keep track of this. I need to list all the entities: people (Alice, Bob, Carol), houses (red, green, blue), and pets (cat, dog, and implicitly a third, or maybe not). I’ll go through the clues one by one and mark my deductions. This is all about finding relationships and cross-references.\nProcessing the Clues and Building Deductions\nFirst clue: Red house = Cat. Easy. Then, Bob doesn’t live in the green house. Noted. Carol owns a dog. Alright, Carol = Dog. The green house is to the left of the red house. Got it, Green &lt; Red. Alice doesn’t own a cat. Now things get interesting!\nI’m starting to see some links here. If the red house has a cat and Alice doesn’t, Alice can’t be in the red house. And since Carol has a dog and the red house has the cat, Carol can’t be in the red house either. That leaves Bob! Bob must be in the Red House with the Cat. Major breakthrough!\nFilling the Gaps and Combining Information\nNow, I know Bob is in the red house. Bob does not live in the green house, that’s already true. I know Carol owns a dog. The houses are arranged Green &lt; Red &lt; Blue. So Green is to the left of Bob. That’s clear.\nSo, it’s either Green, Red, Blue OR Blue, Green, Red. Because Bob is in the Red House, it becomes Green, Bob (Red), Blue. Carol owns the dog, Alice is left. I’m at the point now where I’m trying to decide the houses for the dog and Alice!\nCarol must have the dog in Green or Blue house. No direct information!\nConfronting the Ambiguity and Re-Evaluating\nHmm, this is tricky. No clue is helping me directly match either Carol to Green, or Carol to Blue. I need to rethink the pets. Is there an unstated assumption here? It seems to imply that everyone has a named pet but I’m not seeing how to pair them. I’ve re-read the puzzle and clues many times.\nIf Carol owns the dog, and Bob owns the cat, then what about Alice? No specific pet is associated with Alice. This implies Alice has the unnamed pet or none. My working theory is that there’s an ambiguity in the pet assignments.\nThe crucial constraint is that the green house is to the left of the red house. In three possible arrangements: Green - Red - Blue, Blue - Green - Red, and Green - Blue - Red. I know Bob lives in the Red House, with the cat, that means it’s Green - Bob (Red) - Blue. Then I need to decide, who lives in which house?\nCarol owns the Dog and must be in either the Green or Blue house! Alice is the remaining house. There’s nothing that helps me, at all, decide which person is in what color house, for green and blue!\nAcknowledging the Underspecification\nThere seems to be an ambiguity here. This is a common situation with these puzzles! There might be an unstated assumption that everyone must have a pet in this context. However, I’m stuck with two possible solutions for Alice and Carol, and I don’t see any logic to eliminate either of these solutions.\nFinalized Solution & Acknowledgment of Limitations\nSo, the definite part is: Bob lives in the Red House and owns the Cat. The green house is to the left of Bob’s red house.\nThere are two possibilities:\n\nCarol (Dog) is in the Green House, Alice owns the “unspecified” pet, and lives in Blue house\nCarol (Dog) is in the Blue House, Alice owns the “unspecified” pet, and lives in Green house\n\nI can’t pinpoint a specific pet for Alice. Unless there’s an extremely subtle detail, these are the only two possible consistent solutions.\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nLet’s break this down clue by clue to solve the puzzle:\n\n“The person who lives in the red house owns a cat.”\n\nDeduction: Red House = Cat Owner.\n\n“Carol owns a dog.”\n\nDeduction: Carol = Dog.\n\n“Alice does not own a cat.”\n\nDeduction: Alice is not the Cat Owner.\n\nCombine 1, 2, and 3:\n\nThe Red House owner has a cat.\nAlice does not own a cat, so Alice doesn’t live in the Red House.\nCarol owns a dog, so Carol doesn’t live in the Red House (because the Red House has a cat).\nThis leaves only one person for the Red House: Bob.\nDeduction: Bob lives in the Red House and owns a Cat.\n\n“Bob does not live in the green house.”\n\nThis is consistent with our deduction that Bob lives in the Red House. No new information for Bob, but confirms our path.\n\n“The green house is to the left of the red house.”\n\nWe have three houses: Red, Green, Blue.\nSince Green is to the left of Red, and Bob lives in the Red house, the houses must be in this order from left to right: Green, Red, Blue.\nSo:\n\nLeft house: Green\nMiddle house: Red (Bob, Cat)\nRight house: Blue\n\n\nFinal Assignments for Alice and Carol:\n\nWe know Bob lives in the Red House and owns a cat.\nThe remaining houses are Green and Blue.\nThe remaining people are Alice and Carol.\nWe know Carol owns a dog.\nAlice does not own a cat (which is already true, as Bob owns the cat).\n\nAt this point, the puzzle has two possible solutions for Alice and Carol’s locations and pets, as there’s no further information to distinguish between them:\nPossibility 1:\n\nGreen House: Carol, who owns a dog.\nRed House: Bob, who owns a cat.\nBlue House: Alice, whose pet is not specified by the clues (or she owns no pet explicitly mentioned).\n\nPossibility 2:\n\nGreen House: Alice, whose pet is not specified by the clues (or she owns no pet explicitly mentioned).\nRed House: Bob, who owns a cat.\nBlue House: Carol, who owns a dog.\n\n\nSummary of the solution:\n\nBob: Lives in the Red House and owns a Cat.\n\nAnd then, there are two possibilities for Alice and Carol:\n\nScenario A:\n\nCarol: Lives in the Green House and owns a Dog.\nAlice: Lives in the Blue House and her pet is not specified (or she owns no pet explicitly mentioned by the clues).\n\nScenario B:\n\nAlice: Lives in the Green House and her pet is not specified (or she owns no pet explicitly mentioned by the clues).\nCarol: Lives in the Blue House and owns a Dog.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use see the thought summaries in streaming experiences:\n\nconst thought_experiment_streaming_response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    `\n    Alice, Bob, and Carol each live in a different house on the same street: red, green, and blue.\n    The person who lives in the red house owns a cat.\n    Bob does not live in the green house.\n    Carol owns a dog.\n    The green house is to the left of the red house.\n    Alice does not own a cat.\n    Who lives in each house, and what pet do they own?\n    `,\n  ],\n  config: {\n    thinkingConfig: {\n      includeThoughts: true,\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nlet thoughts = \"\";\nlet answers = \"\";\n\nfor await (const chunk of thought_experiment_streaming_response) {\n  for (const part of chunk.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts ?? []) {\n    if (!part.text) continue;\n    if (part.thought) {\n      if (!thoughts) tslab.display.markdown(`## **Thought Summary**`);\n      tslab.display.markdown(part.text ?? \"\");\n      thoughts += part.text ?? \"\";\n    } else {\n      if (!answers) tslab.display.markdown(`## **Response**`);\n      tslab.display.markdown(part.text ?? \"\");\n      answers += part.text ?? \"\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThought Summary\n\n\nUnpacking the Clues\nI’ve finally started unpacking the core clues of this riddle. Initially, I felt overwhelmed, but now I’m making progress, mapping the houses and pets. I am focusing on eliminating possibilities based on the given constraints. I’m building a matrix to track the relationships, and I think I’m getting close to a breakthrough.\n\n\nDeciphering Relationships\nI’m now diving deeper into the relationships, having established my basic grid. The initial structure feels solid, but the spatial aspect is intriguing. I’m focusing on parsing the first clue about the colors and people, attempting to lay out all permutations and how they impact each other. Right now I am focusing on eliminating contradictory arrangements.\n\n\nConnecting the Dots\nI’ve been meticulously placing clues into the grid, leveraging the established structure. Carol’s dog, and the red house’s cat, are forming key anchors. The spatial clue (“Green to the left of Red”) is proving particularly useful in limiting the possibilities. I’m focusing on the constraints imposed by Bob and Alice to further refine the arrangement.\n\n\nConstructing the Solution\nThe connections are solidifying. I’m now leveraging the logical deductions to finalize the grid, focusing on the house colors. With Bob in Red, and the positional clue about Green, it is starting to become clearer. Determining Alice’s house is key. I’m getting close to the definitive answer.\n\n\nUnveiling the Arrangement\nI’ve finally pinpointed that Bob lives in the red house and owns the cat. Leveraging the spatial clue, I’m now certain Green is to the left of Red. I am determining who lives in the Green and Blue houses and with what pet. I am now working through the final constraint with a clearer picture of the arrangement.\n\n\nSolidifying the Grid\nI’m making progress, but still need to determine who owns the third pet, and whose house is blue. The structure feels much more concrete. Carol owns the dog, and Alice does not own the cat. I am refining the arrangement and building a solution that reflects all the constraints.\n\n\nMapping the Solution\nThe riddle’s framework is solidifying. I’ve placed Bob in the red house with the cat and Carol owning the dog. The positional information about the green house being left of the red is proving key. I’m focusing on Alice’s location and what pet she must have. It’s becoming clearer.\n\n\nSolving the Riddle\nI’ve been working through the clues, using both spatial and direct-relationship constraints to build the solution. Determining Alice and Carol’s houses and pets is the current focus, after correctly placing Bob in the Red house. I am now working through the final house and pet associations.\n\n\nMapping the Final Associations\nI’m zeroing in on the final pieces. Carol and Alice have their houses, the positional clue is helpful. Bob is confirmed in the Red house. The pet situation feels resolved. My primary focus is establishing the definitive house and pet assignments. I’m now certain of the solution.\n\n\nSolving the Puzzle\nI’ve been meticulously following the clues. After placing Bob in the red house with the cat and Carol with the dog, I realized that the “green to the left of red” clue solidifies the positional layout. Now, I’m focusing on Alice and the unknown pet. I’m getting closer to a complete solution.\n\n\nSolving the Puzzle\nI’m now integrating the spatial clue with the pet ownership information, focusing on the house colors. I’ve placed Bob in the red house with the cat, confirming the first part of the riddle. Determining Alice’s association with a house and pet will lead to the final answer. I am making rapid progress now.\n\n\nRevising the Structure\nAfter evaluating multiple permutations, I’ve confirmed Bob lives in the red house with the cat. Carol and Alice occupy the green and blue houses respectively. I’m building out the final assignments for each person and pet.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nAfter assessing multiple structures, I’ve confirmed Bob lives in the red house with the cat, leveraging all available clues. Carol resides in the green house and owns the dog. I am now certain Alice resides in the blue house.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Solution\nThe riddle’s central structure is now solid. Bob lives in the red house, and Carol resides in the green house with her dog, while Alice is confirmed to be in the blue house. The association with the unknown pet is no longer an issue, because the prompt never mentioned a specific pet, only that she did not own a cat. The solution’s finality is clear.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Solution Space\nI’m now zeroing in on a critical point. I’ve deduced Bob lives in the red house with the cat, a solid foundation. The challenge is assigning Carol and Alice’s homes and pets. Currently, their assignments are interchangeable, and the current clues don’t break the tie. I’ll re-evaluate the spatial constraints for clarity.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nIt’s clear that Bob lives in the red house with the cat, a solid foundation. While Carol owns the dog, I’m still weighing the possibilities for Alice’s home and pet situation. The green house to the left of the red house gives an additional hint. My focus is finalizing Carol and Alice’s houses.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nIt’s clear Bob lives in the red house with the cat and Carol has the dog. I’ve placed the Green house to the left of Red. The final piece is linking Alice with Green or Blue, which remains flexible. I’m focusing on Alice’s association and which pet she may have.\n\n\nRe-evaluating the Structure\nAfter solidifying the core relationships, I am evaluating possible permutations, leveraging the established base. Bob is confirmed in the red house, leaving the assignment of Carol and Alice’s homes open. I am focusing on positional constraints to determine the definitive assignments. The final answer feels close.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Solution Space\nI’m wrestling with the final assignments, as the two remaining arrangements feel equally valid. Bob is definitively in the red house with the cat, and Carol has the dog. My attention is on Alice, the remaining house, and the “not cat” clue. I must ensure I do not over-interpret the final constraints. I’m focusing on the spatial and relational aspects.\n\n\nMapping the Final Associations\nThe riddle’s structure is clear. Bob is in the red house with the cat, and Carol has the dog. The spatial clue about the green house being left of the red is key. My focus is finalizing Alice’s location and possible pet. It’s becoming clearer.\n\n\nRe-evaluating the Structure\nThe solution feels very clear; however, I am now focused on a possible “no pet” scenario. Alice’s “not cat” clue makes me consider she owns nothing, or, perhaps, a pet we are not privy to. Since there are only two pets, “no pet” seems the implicit rule.\n\n\nFinalizing the Arrangements\nI am now certain that Bob lives in the red house with the cat, confirming the grid’s structure. By deducing Alice’s and Carol’s possible arrangements, their final assignments should be easier to deduce. However, the constraints are a little tricky. I’m focusing on Alice’s pet status.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nIt’s clear that Bob lives in the red house with the cat and Carol resides in the green house with her dog, while Alice is confirmed to be in the blue house. It is starting to feel conclusive, as the solution now is clear.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nIt’s clear I’m working through the connections between the people, houses, and pets with diligence. Bob in the red house with the cat is now firmly established. Carol and Alice occupy green and blue houses respectively. I’m focusing on the final assignment to make a fully conclusive solution.\n\n\nFinalizing the Solution\nThe connections are established. I’ve placed Bob in the red house with the cat, leveraging all available clues. Carol resides in the green house and owns the dog, while Alice is confirmed in the blue house. The association with the unknown pet is no longer an issue, because the prompt never mentioned a specific pet. The solution’s finality is clear.\n\n\nSynthesizing the Solution\nThe riddle’s structure is clear, and I’ve placed Bob in the red house with the cat, leveraging all of the clues. The spatial clue about the green house being to the left of the red is also key. However, I am still trying to determine the relationship between Alice, Carol, and the other houses, with the riddle’s ambiguity being somewhat challenging to overcome.\n\n\nDeciphering the Relationships\nMy recent focus has been on parsing the clues regarding spatial positioning and direct relationships, having mapped the basic structure. The “Green to the left of Red” clue is critical, but it isn’t definitive on who resides in Green or Blue. Determining the pet for Alice is a key concern.\n\n\nRevising the Structure\nAfter reevaluating the constraints, I’m confident in Bob’s red house and cat ownership. The spatial element is clear, green is left of red. Currently, the riddle doesn’t differentiate between the arrangements of Carol and Alice’s homes. I will work further on Carol’s dog.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nAfter considering several arrangements, I am convinced that Bob lives in the red house with the cat, a firm starting point. The crucial part, however, is now trying to determine Alice and Carol’s assignments. The green house being to the left of the red house gives an added hint, however, the structure remains ambiguous.\n\n\nSynthesizing the Structure\nThe solution space is clarifying. I’ve placed Bob in the red house with the cat, a firm foundation. Carol owns the dog. The challenge is assigning the final pet and the Green and Blue houses. I’m focusing on the spatial constraint, but can’t distinguish between Alice and Carol.\n\n\nDeciphering the Relationships\nI’ve been meticulously analyzing the clues, starting to form a clear structure. I’m focusing on Carol’s Dog, Bob in Red, and spatial positions. Alice’s possible pet ownership is now my main priority; I’m building a solution that addresses her specific pet associations and house color.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Structure\nThe logical puzzle is now fully parsed. Bob is in the red house with the cat, a firm conclusion. The key constraints about Carol and Alice, the spatial aspect, and the pets require careful consideration, and I will continue to work on it with greater efficiency.\n\n\nI’m focusing on parsing the relationships within the riddle’s structure, aiming for definitive assignments. Bob is firmly established in the red house with the cat, a crucial starting point. My current focus centers on Alice and Carol, the green and blue houses, and the riddle’s implied “no pet” rule.\n\n\nParsing the Clues\nI’ve carefully examined the clues and established the core structure: Bob resides in the red house with the cat, Carol owns the dog, and Alice does not own the cat. The riddle’s focus is to determine the assignment of Green and Blue houses and the association of the remaining two pets and Alice’s assignment. I’m focusing on the spatial relationship.\n\n\nRevising the Structure\nHaving confirmed the basic framework, I’m now focused on the final assignments. Bob resides in the red house with the cat, and Carol has the dog. My attention shifts to Alice’s “not cat” situation and her house assignment. Leveraging the spatial clue, I’m analyzing potential placements to reach a conclusive solution.\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nLet’s break down the clues to solve this logic puzzle:\n1. Create a Grid to Organize Information:\n\n\n\nPerson\nHouse\nPet\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n\n\n\n\nBob\n\n\n\n\nCarol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Process Each Clue:\n\nClue 1: “Alice, Bob, and Carol each live in a different house on the same street: red, green, and blue.”\n\nConfirms a 1:1 mapping of people, houses, and (implicitly) pets.\n\n\n\n\n\nClue 2: “The person who lives in the red house owns a cat.”\n\n(Red House) -&gt; Cat\n\n\n\n\n\nClue 3: “Bob does not live in the green house.”\n\nBob ≠ Green House\n\n\n\n\n\nClue 4: “Carol owns a dog.”\n\nAdd this directly to the grid: Carol -&gt; Dog\n\nClue 5: “The green house is to the left of the red house.”\n\nThis establishes a spatial relationship: Green &lt; Red\n\n\n\n\n\nClue 6: “Alice does not own a cat.”\n\nAlice ≠ Cat\n\n\n3. Deductions:\n\n\n\nDeduction 1: Identify the Cat Owner.\n\nFrom Clue 4, Carol owns a dog. So Carol is not the cat owner.\nFrom Clue 6, Alice does not own a cat.\nSince Alice and Carol don’t own the cat, Bob must own the cat.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduction 2: Identify Who Lives in the Red House.\n\nFrom Clue 2, the Red House owner has a cat.\nFrom Deduction 1, Bob owns the cat.\nTherefore, Bob lives in the Red House.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the Grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerson\nHouse\nPet\n\n\n\n\nAlice\n\nNot Cat\n\n\nBob\nRed\nCat\n\n\nCarol\n\nDog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduction 3: Assign Remaining People to Houses.\n\nWe know Bob lives in the Red House.\nFrom Clue 6, Alice does not own a cat, so she cannot live in the Red House (where the cat owner lives).\nFrom Clue 4, Carol owns a dog, so she cannot live in the Red House (where the cat owner lives).\nThis means the Green House and the Blue House must be occupied by Alice and Carol.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduction 4: Consider the “to the left” clue.\n\nClue 5 states: “The green house is to the left of the red house.”\nWe know Bob is in the Red House. So the Green house is to the left of Bob’s house.\nThis means the street arrangement is either: [Blue] [Green] [Red (Bob)] or [Green] [Red (Bob)] [Blue].\nThis clue helps establish the relative positions of the houses, but it does not provide any information to definitively place Alice or Carol in the Green house versus the Blue house. Both scenarios (Alice in Green, Carol in Blue OR Carol in Green, Alice in Blue) are consistent with all given clues.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the information provided, we can definitively determine Bob’s house and pet, and Carol’s pet.\n\n\nHowever, the clues do not provide enough information to definitively determine whether Alice lives in the Green or Blue house, or Carol lives in the Green or Blue house. The problem implies a unique solution, but the information to distinguish between Alice and Carol’s houses is missing.\n\n\nHowever, if we are to provide a complete answer with the most logical deduction based on the usual structure of these puzzles (where there should be a unique pet for each person): Alice’s pet is not a cat, and Carol has a dog. Bob has the cat. This means Alice must have a third, unnamed pet, or no pet.\n\n\nHere’s the most complete and certain answer:\n\nBob lives in the Red House and owns a cat.\nCarol owns a dog.\nAlice does not own a cat.\n\n\n\nSince Alice and Carol are the only ones left for the Green and Blue houses, and there’s no further distinguishing information:\n\nThe Green House is occupied by either Alice (who does not own a cat) or Carol (who owns a dog).\nThe Blue House is occupied by the other person (Alice or Carol).",

    "text": "Working with Gemini thinking models and tools\nGemini thinking models are compatible with the tools and capabilities inherent to the Gemini ecosystem. This compatibility allows them to interface with external environments, execute computational code, or retrieve real-time data, subsequently incorporating such information into their analytical framework and concluding statements.\n\nSolving a problem using the code execution tool\nThis example shows how to use the code execution tool to solve a problem. The model will generate the code and then execute it to get the final answer.\nIn this case, you are using the adaptive thinking_budget so the model will dynamically adjust the budget based on the complexity of the request.\nIf you want to experiment with a fixed budget, you can set the thinkingBudget to a specific value (e.g. thinkingBudget=4096).\n\nconst code_experiment_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    `\n    What are the best ways to sort a list of n numbers from 0 to m?\n    Generate and run Python code for three different sort algorithms.\n    Provide the final comparison between algorithm clearly.\n    Is one of them linear?\n    `,\n  ],\n  config: {\n    tools: [{ codeExecution: {} }],\n    thinkingConfig: {\n      thinkingBudget: 4096,\n    },\n  },\n});\nfor (const part of code_experiment_response.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts ??

They can achieve linear time complexity.\n\nCounting Sort: Ideal when m is relatively small. It works by counting the occurrences of each distinct element and then using those counts to determine the sorted position of each element.\nRadix Sort: Efficient when m is very large but the numbers have a limited number of digits or bits. It sorts numbers digit by digit (or bit by bit) using a stable sorting algorithm (often Counting Sort) as a subroutine.\n\nComparison Sorts (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort): These are general-purpose sorting algorithms that work by comparing elements. Their lower bound for time complexity is O(n log n), regardless of the range of numbers. They are suitable when m is very large, making non-comparison sorts less efficient or impractical due to memory constraints.\n\nGiven the constraint 0 to m, Counting Sort stands out as a highly relevant and potentially linear-time algorithm.\nLet’s proceed with implementing and running three different sort algorithms: Counting Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, and then compare them.\n\n1.

In such cases, Counting Sort is a linear-time sorting algorithm.\nIn our test case, n = 100,000 and m = 50,000. Since m is less than n and of the same order of magnitude, Counting Sort performs exceptionally well, significantly faster than the O(n log n) comparison sorts.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFor sorting n numbers from 0 to m:\n\nCounting Sort is the clear winner when m is not significantly larger than n (e.g., m is comparable to n, or even m &lt; n). It leverages the limited range of values to achieve linear time complexity, making it much faster than comparison-based sorts in such scenarios, as demonstrated by the performance difference (0.066s vs ~0.3-0.4s).\nMerge Sort is a solid general-purpose choice, always providing O(n log n) performance and stability, but at the cost of O(n) auxiliary space.\nQuick Sort is generally faster in practice than Merge Sort for average cases due to better cache performance and lower constant factors, despite the theoretical worst-case O(n²) complexity. However, its simple Python implementation used here consumes O(n) space and is not truly in-place.\n\nTherefore, for the specific problem of sorting numbers from 0 to m, Counting Sort is generally the “best” way if m is within a reasonable range, as it provides linear time complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking with search tool\nSearch grounding is a great way to improve the quality of the model responses by giving it the ability to search for the latest information using Google Search. Check the dedicated guide for more details on that feature.\nIn this case, you are using the adaptive thinkingBudget so the model will dynamically adjust the budget based on the complexity of the request.\nIf you want to experiment with a fixed budget, you can set the thinkingBudget to a specific value (e.g. thinkingBudget=4096).\n\nconst search_response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: MODEL_ID,\n  contents: [\n    `\n    What were the major scientific breakthroughs announced last month?

My next step involves conducting focused Google searches using various relevant terms to unearth noteworthy scientific breakthroughs from that period. I’ll then critically assess these findings. I’m prioritizing reputable sources to identify genuinely impactful advancements.\n\n\nNarrowing Down Breakthroughs\nI’ve significantly refined the initial list of potential breakthroughs, prioritizing findings that are truly impactful and novel. The “conversion of lead to gold” has been removed due to potential sensationalism, while the impressive count of Saturn’s moons, and the potential impacts of vitamin D have been deprioritized for now. I’m focusing on the record-breaking redshift galaxy, the fusion milestone, the OCD gene discovery, night-vision lenses, green hydrogen, the new material, the solid-tumor CAR-T success, brain cell repair, and the AI co-scientist. I believe that these are solid candidates for “incredible” breakthroughs worthy of further analysis. Also, I’m watching the pancreatic cancer vaccine and AI-powered cancer detection advancements with great interest, as these present huge potential.\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nLast month, May 2025, saw several significant scientific announcements across various fields, pointing to incredible progress in our understanding of the universe, advancements in medicine, and innovative technological developments.\nIn the realm of space and astronomy:\n\nMost Distant Galaxy Ever Detected: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) confirmed MoM-z14 as the most distant galaxy ever detected, with a redshift of 14.44. This places its formation within 280 million years of the Big Bang, offering unprecedented insights into the early universe.\nNew Exoplanets Around Barnard’s Star: Astronomers confirmed the existence of three new rocky exoplanets, all smaller than Earth, orbiting Barnard’s Star, the closest solitary star to our Sun. This brings the total number of known planets around Barnard’s Star to four, including the previously hinted-at Barnard b.\n\nIn medicine and health:\n\nBreakthrough in OCD Genetics: For the first time, researchers identified 250 genes linked to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) through a study involving over 2 million people. This discovery represents a significant step towards understanding the genetic underpinnings of the condition.\nNight-Vision Contact Lenses: Scientists developed contact lenses that grant “super-vision,” allowing users to perceive beyond the visible light spectrum and detect infrared light even in darkness or with closed eyes. This innovation could potentially replace traditional night-vision goggles.\nRepairing Brain Cells: New research demonstrated that brain cells can be repaired, with a drug known as antisense oligonucleotide successfully repairing human neurons in individuals with Timothy’s syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. This breakthrough offers hope for treating other genetic conditions affecting the brain, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder.\nLong-Term Cancer Remission with CAR-T Therapy: A child who received CAR-T cancer therapy for neuroblastoma 18 years ago remains disease-free, suggesting that this personalized cancer treatment may be effective not only for blood cancers but also for solid tumors.\n\nIn physics and energy:\n\nNew Nuclear Fusion Record: The WEST tokamak in France set a new world record for nuclear fusion by maintaining plasma for an impressive 1,337 seconds, a 25% increase over the previous record. This is a crucial step forward in the quest for sustainable fusion energy.\nSunlight-Powered Green Hydrogen Production: Scientists created a prototype reactor capable of harvesting hydrogen fuel using only sunlight and water. This advancement could revolutionize renewable energy by providing a cost-effective method for producing “green hydrogen.”\nFirst 2D Mechanically Interlocked Material: Northwestern University demonstrated the creation of the first two-dimensional (2D) mechanically interlocked material. Described as possessing exceptional flexibility and strength with 100 trillion bonds per square centimeter, this new class of material could have wide-ranging applications.\n\nIn artificial intelligence:\n\nAI Co-Scientist for Accelerated Discovery: An “AI Co-Scientist” was developed as a collaborative tool to assist scientists in generating novel hypotheses and research proposals. This AI has shown promise in areas such as drug repurposing and proposing new treatment targets, potentially accelerating the pace of biomedical discoveries.\n\n\n\nSearch Results\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    top research announcements May 2025\n    major scientific breakthroughs May 2025\n    significant science discoveries May 2025",

If using, gently fold in the food coloring at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Macaronage.\nPour the sifted dry ingredients into the meringue. Using a spatula, gently fold the mixture together using a circular motion, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Continue folding until the batter flows off your spatula in a thick ribbon and slowly melts back into the mixture in about 10-20 seconds. This is the macaronage stage, and it’s crucial not to overmix or undermix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Pipe the macarons.\nTransfer the macaron batter into the prepared piping bag. Pipe small, even circles onto the parchment-lined baking sheets. Aim for consistent sizes, about 1.5 inches in diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Tap the trays.\nFirmly tap the baking sheets several times on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop any visible bubbles on the surface of the macarons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Rest the macarons.\nLet the piped macaron shells sit at room temperature for 30-60 minutes, or until a skin forms on the surface. You should be able to gently touch them without the batter sticking to your finger. This step is crucial for developing the “feet.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Bake the macarons.\nPreheat your oven to the correct temperature (usually between 285-325°F or 140-160°C, depending on your oven). Bake one tray at a time for 12-18 minutes, or until the “feet” have formed and the shells don’t wiggle when gently touched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Cool and fill.\nLet the baked macaron shells cool completely on the baking sheets before attempting to remove them. Once cooled, match the shells by size and pipe your desired filling (like buttercream, ganache, or jam) onto the flat side of one shell. Gently sandwich it with another shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Mature (optional but recommended).\nFor the best flavor and texture, place the filled macarons in an airtight container and refrigerate them for at least 12-24 hours. This allows the flavors to meld and the filling to soften the shells slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy your homemade macarons! They are delicate and can be tricky, so don’t be discouraged if your first attempt isn’t perfect. Practice makes perfect!",
