    "# Guide: Building AI Tutors with LearnLM via System Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage LearnLM, an experimental task-specific model trained to align with learning science principles, to create various AI tutoring experiences. The key to directing LearnLM's capabilities lies in crafting effective system instructions for teaching and learning use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "LearnLM is designed to facilitate behaviors like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspiring active learning\n",
    "- Managing cognitive load\n",
    "- Adapting to the learner\n",
    "- Stimulating curiosity\n",
    "- Deepening metacognition\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates these principles by illustrating how system instructions and user prompts enable LearnLM to act as different types of tutors."
